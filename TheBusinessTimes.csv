2022-04-11,Data centre S-Reits committed to sustainable growth,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/data-centre-s-reits-committed-sustainable-growth-0,"THE data centre industry has experienced tremendous growth in the past 2 years, as businesses are faced with a sudden and increased need for greater cloud capacity to enable work-from-home arrangements.
According to Cushman & Wakefield's 2022 Global Data Center Market Comparison report, the top 10 markets with the greatest capacity under development include London, Northern Virginia, Silicon Valley, Atlanta, Chicago, Dublin, Hong Kong, Phoenix, Singapore and Jakarta.
The report also highlighted the 3 main types of challenges and responsibilities that data centre operators face. These include the ability to source for renewable energy, the ability to develop better methods of cooling servers and the ability to design more efficient facilities to meet the sustainability goals of clients and governments.
In Singapore, data centres accounted for 7 per cent of Singapore's total electricity consumption in 2020.
Earlier this year, the moratorium on new data centres in Singapore was lifted, with certain criteria on energy efficiency.
Minister for Trade and Industry, Gan Kim Yong had said that the government had ""to find a way to manage the growth of data centres in a sustainable manner consistent with our climate change commitments""."
2022-04-11,S-Reits punching above their weight in the global arena,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/wealth-investing/s-reits-punching-above-their-weight-global-arena,"SINGAPORE Real Estate Investment Trusts (Reits) are turning the corner with the recent announcements to lift Covid-19 restrictions.

Despite the rising rate environment, Reits have steadily been an active sector among investors. Even institutional investors who were previously overall net sellers in the Singapore market year to date, have turned net buyers of S-Reits since February 2022. Looking comparatively at the global landscape, the iEdge S-Reit Index gained 1.3 per cent year-to-date versus -4.9 per cent average for Global Reits and -4.6 per cent for S&P 500 for the first quarter of 2022.

What is driving the resilience of the Singapore Reit sector against its global peers?

In the last decade, Asia has been a significant contributor to the growth of the global Reit sector. Although the US dominates the global Reit market and continues to grow strongly, there has been significant growth in Asia, especially from the 3 largest markets in Asia - Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong.

Singapore Reits (S-Reits) are an important component of the local market, comprising 13 per cent of the Singapore Exchange's (SGX) market capitalisation. This ratio is the highest globally across stock markets in the world and speaks volumes about the sector's importance to the Singapore market.

Small yet powerful

Singapore, though small in land size, is home to one of the world's most diverse collections of Reits, with around 85 per cent of S-Reits and property trusts owning properties outside of Singapore. In most other regions, Reit assets are predominantly based locally. This makes the Singapore Reit sector unique in terms of asset and geography diversification.

It is perhaps this diversification that has helped S-Reits be one of the most resilient among its peers. When you put together the 10 best performing S-Reits and property trusts with over a 10-year listing history, they have averaged 12.5 per cent in 10-year annualised total returns versus 10 per cent in Apac-based Reits.

Brighter days ahead for Singapore Reits

Looking at 2022 alone, the iEdge S-Reit index is now up 4.5 per cent in March alone, having rallied sharply after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced the easing of safe management rules.

In the months ahead, S-Reits seem poised to continue their recovery trajectory as Singapore and the world re-opens.

S-Reits are widely seen as resilient income generators. They have another edge: Reits tend to do well during inflationary periods.

To use an example from the US, when we compare US Reits and the S&P 500 during different inflationary periods, we see Reits outperforming considerably when inflation is moderately high. Moderate inflation is defined to be more than 2.5 per cent annually.

I would expect to see this trend play out in Singapore too. The Monetary Authority of Singapore expects core inflation to be closer to 3 per cent this year.

As prices rise, so do rents. This increases the amount of rental income Reits can earn - benefits that are then passed on to the investor.

Reits can weather rate hikes

Although Reits are sensitive to interest rates, given the impact on borrowing costs and yield spreads, S-Reits took the Fed rate hike in March in stride. One driver of this resilience is S-Reits' prudent management of interest rate risks. According to SGX Research, this results in a low correlation with US interest rate cycles historically. Additionally, S-Reits currently have an average gearing ratio of 37 per cent, comfortably below the regulatory threshold of 50 per cent. This means that S-Reits can service their debt and still have room to raise more debt acquisitions or operations.

Retail Reits benefit from Singapore's reopening

Retail Reits are poised for growth now that social distancing measures have eased.

Centrally-located malls in particular stand to benefit from the return of the office crowd and the resumption of travel. These malls tend to cater more to tourists, which all but dried up in the midst of the pandemic.

Since late last year, we've seen a gradual recovery in retail sales. Singapore retail sales grew 11.8 per cent in January 2022 on a year-over-year basis, marking the fifth straight month of gains for retail sales. This uptrend is another positive for the performance of retail Reits going forward.

Singapore office assets to recover

Grade A office rents in Singapore's Central Business District (CBD) saw the fastest quarterly growth in Q1 2022, according to JLL Singapore in a recent report. Overall, rental rates have recovered by 6.9 per cent since bottoming in Q1 2021.

In light of limited new office supply and more ageing office buildings taken off stream for redevelopment, Cushman & Wakefield have forecasted CBD Grade A office rents to grow 4.6 per cent year on year in 2022.

This positive momentum in office rental rates supports a brighter outlook for Singapore office Reits. Additionally, with up to three-quarters of office workers being allowed to return to their workplaces, we could see increased leasing activities and more buoyant sentiment.

Data centres and logistics properties remain in demand

Beyond the reopening play and relaxation of Covid rules, structural trends that were accelerated by the pandemic will continue to play out. This includes a strong e-commerce adoption rate and the rapid growth of the digital economy.

These factors will continue to drive robust demand for new economy assets like data centres and modernised logistics space.

In recent times, data centres have become an essential asset as the world consumes and produces more and more data each day. S-Reits that traditionally focused on industrial assets are now expanding their data centre investments. Last year, Ascendas Reit and Mapletree Industrial Reit announced their acquisition of data centres in Europe and the US respectively.

According to DBS Research, new economy assets now occupy over 90 per cent of large-cap industrial Reits' portfolios. Going forward, this pivot to new economy assets could potentially translate into earnings and DPU growth for many large-cap industrial Reits.

2022-04-14,"I'm not the kingmaker,' says Sabana Reit director whom Quarz wants voted out",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/im-not-kingmaker-says-sabana-reit-director-whom-quarz-wants-voted-out,"SABANA Industrial Real Estate Investment Trust (Sabana Reit) is staring down the barrel of yet another crucial vote that could have a major impact on its plans going forward.

This comes 16 months after its proposed merger with ESR-Reit was voted down by unitholders in December 2020.


Instrumental in that defeat - the first time in the history of Singapore's real estate investment trust (Reit) market that a proposed merger had been voted down - was activist fund manager Quarz Capital Management.

Quarz is now rallying unitholders to reject 3 of the 5 resolutions that Sabana Reit has tabled for its annual general meeting (AGM) on Apr 26.

At the centre of the storm is hedge fund founder and former Credit Suisse trader Chan Wai Kheong, who was appointed as an independent non-executive director of the Reit in June last year."
2022-04-14,Property listcos have more women chair than those in other sectors,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/property/property-listcos-have-more-women-chair-those-other-sectors,"CLOSE to 18 per cent of the real estate service firms and real estate investment trusts (Reits) listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) have an executive chairwoman on their board of directors.

That is higher than the 7 per cent of all SGX-listed companies (listcos) with women chairing their boards as at the end of 2021, an analysis by the Institute of Real Estate and Urban Studies (IREUS) shows.

Among the 100 biggest companies on the bourse, 9 were chaired by women, also a smaller proportion than in the property sector.

IREUS examined a sample of 99 firms in real estate services, including developers, and Reits listed on SGX. The research institute noted that about 21 per cent of these property service firms and Reits are led by women chief executive officers. And on average, women held around 13.2 per cent of board seats in the real estate sector, based on data from the companies' latest annual reports. This proportion is close to the overall average for all SGX-listed companies in recent months.

Women's participation on the boards of SGX-listed companies has been increasing over the years, reaching an average share of 13.6 per cent in January 2022, statistics from Singapore's Council for Board Diversity showed. This is up from 13.5 per cent in December 2021 and 8.3 per cent in December 2013.
However, going by IREUS' findings, the relationship between the number of board positions filled by women and the return on equity is not distinct.

When the trend line - that is, the best-fit straight line - of the returns in 2021 is plotted against the proportion of female directors, it appears flattish.

Still, the property names with a proportion of more than 30 per cent women on their boards seem to have a higher average return on equity than those with none.

IREUS deputy director Lee Nai Jia said: ""The relationship between women's participation in boards and the returns appears weakly positive at this juncture, partly due to bunching effects - most firms have either a 10 to 20 per cent female representation on their boards or an all-male board.

""That said, the results are encouraging, though more research is needed to isolate the causes.""

The case for gender-balanced boards is as much about improving company performance and other economic considerations as it is about gender parity and creating equal opportunities for both women and men, Dr Lee added.

Gender diversity is one of the indicators of board diversity, and more organisations are increasingly approaching it as a value driver in organisational strategy and corporate governance.

Some studies argue that a heterogeneous board of directors benefits from a more thorough consideration of problems and solutions, which in turn enhances board independence. Moreover, a diverse leadership team may be able to increase a firm's competitiveness by leveraging a larger network of contacts, as well as broader expertise and experience.

The Council for Board Diversity stated in its March 2022 report that 21 companies, out of the top 100 companies on SGX, have consistently maintained gender diversity on their boards since 2013 or their listing dates.

The 21 included Reits such as Lendlease Global Commercial Reit, which had women making up 40 per cent of its directors as at December 2021; and SPH Reit, Mapletree Commercial Trust, Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust and Prime US Reit, each with 33 per cent.

2022-04-19,Time to double down on S-Reit investments amid MAS 'double barrel' policy tightening,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/time-double-down-s-reit-investments-amid-mas-double-barrel-policy?login=true&close=true,"INFLATION is poised to continue rising, as signalled by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)'s decision last week to tighten its monetary policy for the third time in 6 months.
Investors seeking a hedge against inflation should take yet another look at Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits).
The central bank on Apr 14 raised its inflation forecasts sharply for 2022, even as it announced an aggressive double-tightening move: recentring the mid-point of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band at the prevailing rate and slightly raising the rate of appreciation of the policy band.
Put simply, this means the Singapore dollar (SGD) will be allowed to appreciate to a higher level and at a faster pace. The appreciation of the local currency against the currencies of its major trading partners helps to reduce the prices paid in SGD for imported goods and services.
Meanwhile, MAS also raised its headline inflation forecast by 200 basis points (bps) to a range of 4.5 to 5.5 per cent. Its core inflation forecast was raised by 50 bps to between 2.5 and 3.5 per cent.
In a statement, the central bank said ""underlying inflationary pressures remain a risk over the medium term""."
2022-04-21,Border reopening is godsend to Singapore retail space landlords,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/border-reopening-godsend-singapore-retail-space-landlords,"AFTER several stops and starts along the way, it looks like things have finally reached an inflection point for the retail sector.
The easing of travel curbs through the launch of the Vaccinated Travel Framework is gradually helping to bring tourists back to Singapore, which should benefit shopping malls in areas popular with holiday-makers, such as the Orchard Road shopping belt.
The Central Business District (CBD), meanwhile, is starting to regain a bit of buzz after the government lifted capacity limits in offices to 75 per cent, up from 50 per cent.
Footfall is also expected to pick up as larger groups of vaccinated people are now able to dine together. This could give tenants greater confidence in the re-opening trajectory, which in time could encourage them to expand their footprint.
In addition, landlords should be able to look forward to improving rental reversions as tenant sales pick up. CGS-CIMB analyst Lock Mun Yee estimates that rental reversions will see stability to low single digit improvements for 2022.
On the flipside, it's worth noting that Singapore residents will likely seize the opportunity to pack their bags and head abroad during the school holidays. An exodus of residents could impact takings, especially at suburban malls."
2022-04-21,"Green commercial, logistics properties' valuations more resilient: IREUS",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/property/green-commercial-logistics-properties-valuations-more-resilient-ireus,"ENVIRONMENTALLY friendly properties tended to perform better during the global pandemic, with generally smaller drops in valuations when compared to buildings without green certification, an analysis by the Institute of Real Estate and Urban Studies (IREUS) found.
It compared the changes in the values of properties held by Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits), across different sectors and countries, between fiscal years 2019 and 2020.
The analysis, based on data extracted from the S-Reits' annual reports, excluded recently-acquired buildings, which did not have previous valuations for comparison.
Green commercial buildings in particular proved more resilient against Covid-19 pandemic headwinds than their counterparts that are not green certified.
For example, in the retail sector, values declined by an average of 1.6 per cent in FY2020 for green properties, markedly less than the 5.5 per cent decrease for those without any green certification.
Business parks saw values grow by 2.8 per cent for green-certified buildings, in contrast to a 0.4 per cent dip for the others.
Some asset classes that thrived during the pandemic, such as logistics properties, also performed better when it came to green buildings versus non-green ones.
Green logistics and warehouse assets on average enjoyed a 12.7 per cent jump in valuations, a far cry from the 4.9 per cent uptick for those without a green label.
However, in what appears to be a departure from expectations, data centres and light industrial buildings that are not green-certified actually did better than their counterparts.
Green data centres posted a 2.8 per cent increase in values in FY2020, while those without certification clocked a 4.2 per cent rise.
Lee Nai Jia, deputy director of IREUS at the National University of Singapore, said that at the moment, there are not many data centres with green certification, especially those that are outside Singapore.
""Hence, the higher valuations may reflect the market conditions in countries without green certification schemes, which may have skewed valuation trends in countries offering such schemes for data centres,"" he added.
As for light industrial buildings, green ones saw values fall 4.8 per cent, as opposed to a 6.6 per cent growth for the rest.
Dr Lee noted that expiring land tenures may have contributed to the decline in valuations of environmentally friendly, light industrial buildings, especially sites with fewer than 40 years remaining.
""On the whole, the values of commercial buildings with green certification seem more resilient during the pandemic. Given the uncertainty arising from geopolitical tensions and rising energy costs, these buildings are anticipated to do better than their counterparts that are not green-certified, as their energy savings will be higher,"" he added.
Construction and the built environment are responsible for 39 per cent of all carbon emissions worldwide, with operational emissions from energy used to heat, cool and illuminate buildings accounting for 28 per cent, non-profit World Green Building Council has said.
IREUS noted that against the backdrop of such a substantial carbon footprint, green buildings play a key role in slowing global warming, and there is also an economic case for such assets.
One of the earliest studies on the price premiums of environmentally sustainable properties was a paper in 2010, titled Doing well by doing good? Green office buildings, published by the American Economic Association.
The researchers found that US office buildings with a green rating commanded a premium of above 7 per cent in effective rents, while the selling prices of green buildings were higher by about 16 per cent.
A June 2021 report by JLL noted that 7 in 10 corporations in Asia-Pacific were willing to pay higher rents to lease sustainability-certified buildings in the future.
Also, the majority of corporate occupiers currently leasing space in a green building were paying 7 per cent to 10 per cent more rent, JLL said."
2022-04-27,Sustainability-linked loans trump other green finance for Singapore property firms,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/property/sustainability-linked-loans-trump-other-green-finance-singapore-property-firms,"PROPERTY firms and real estate investment trusts (Reits) bagged nearly half of the green debt raised by Singapore companies last year, with sustainability-linked loans making up the lion's share, according to an analysis by the Institute of Real Estate and Urban Studies (IREUS).
Lee Nai Jia, deputy director of IREUS at the National University of Singapore, said the real estate sector is likely to be among the leaders in sustainable financing in the immediate future, as there are well-established standards for green building certification.
He expects both green and sustainability-linked financing to increase their market share among the available debt instruments. ""Higher oil prices and the imposition of carbon taxes, together with greater investment appetite for sustainable investments, should continue to drive sustainable financing,"" Dr Lee added.
The research institute's analysis of data from financial markets data and infrastructure provider Refinitiv showed that the market for green and sustainability-linked financing in Singapore started to pick up in 2019.
The amount of such debt obtained by firms domiciled in the city-state also reached a new high in 2021, charting the ""meteoric rise"" of a debt market that did not exist just a decade ago, IREUS noted.
Green and sustainability-linked debt clinched by Singapore companies across all sectors in 2021 surged to S$163.2 billion, which is almost 5 times the S$32.9 billion a year ago."

The increase comes despite FCT retaining S$4.8 million of its taxable income available for distribution to unitholders in H1.
In a briefing accompanying the results announcement on Apr 27, chief executive officer of FCT's manager, Richard Ng, said the retention was for ""prudence"" as the latest easing of Singapore's Covid-related safe management measures had not yet been announced when the terms of the distribution were being worked out.
""When we made the decision, the announcement hadn't taken place. And so, while we were confident that we should expect more lifting of the measures, the clarity wasn't there,"" Ng said.
""Largely, the amount set aside was just for prudence,"" he added. ""There's another 6 months to go (in this fiscal year); we are doing well, but we want to be prudent.""
The retained amount is expected to be distributed in the second half. ""As far as FCT is concerned, we distribute at least 90 per cent of all our taxable income every year,"" Ng said."

The offer price is 3.9 per cent below SPH Reit's last traded price, on Thursday (Apr 28), of S$0.975. It is also 2.8 per cent below SPH Reit's daily volume-weighted average price (VWAP) over the last month.
The offer by Cuscaden is required by the Singapore Code on Take-overs and Mergers, as Cuscaden and its concert parties would own 47.2 per cent of SPH Reit following the completion of an offer by Cuscaden to take Singapore Press Holdings : T39 0% (SPH) private.
The minimum chain offer price was determined by the daily VWAP of SPH Reit for the 20 trading days prior to Cuscaden's initial announcement of the proposed offer for SPH, on Oct 29, or whatever number of trading days there were within the 30 calendar days prior.
Cuscaden has also exercised its right to reduce the minimum price by distributions paid on or after Nov 15, which was when the scheme for the SPH offer was announced.
The offer is, however, conditional upon Cuscaden and its concert parties holding more than 50 per cent of SPH Reit at the close of the offer. Cuscaden said it does not intend to ""actively pursue the delisting of SPH Reit"". Nevertheless, if the free float requirement that 10 per cent of units are held by the public is not satisfied, Cuscaden will proceed to compulsorily acquire all outstanding units and delist SPH Reit."

In the quarter, the UK-focused real estate investment trust (Reit) recorded a full quarter of contribution from its maiden acquisition, and it also had tax savings from the admission of Elite UK Commercial Holdings as a UK Reit group, although this was offset by a slightly enlarged equity base, the manager said on Friday (Apr 29).
Gross revenue was up 39.4 per cent to £9.2 million (S$15.9 million) for the quarter, from £6.6 million a year ago.
Distributable income rose 36.2 per cent on year to £6.1 million, from £4.5 million a year ago.
The Reit saw positive outcomes from its major lease re-gearing exercise, where it removed a number of lease break options that were set to occur in March 2023 to enhance lease stability.
It had the option removed from 109 assets occupied by the UK’s Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and Ministry of Defence (MOD), which it said provides lease stability and income visibility until March 2028 for 85.2 per cent of its total portfolio."

Both research teams from DBS Group Research and Maybank Securities have maintained their “buy” calls on the counter.
This comes as the Reit posts a 5 per cent rise in distribution per unit (DPU) of S$0.02268 for the fourth quarter ended March, from S$0.02161 in the year-ago period, despite an enlarged unit base. The amount distributable to unitholders rose 16.7 per cent to S$108 million in Q4.
DBS has lowered its target price to S$2.05 from S$2.35 to account for higher discount rate assumptions, although it adjusted its earnings estimates slightly upwards to account for recently announced acquisitions.
DBS's new target price implies a potential upside of 13.3 per cent from MLT’s last trading price of S$1.81 as at 2.53 pm on Friday. The counter was trading 1.7 per cent or S$0.03 higher at the time.
Meanwhile, Maybank cut its target price on MLT to S$2.25 from S$2.35. The new target represents a potential upside of 24.3 per cent.
Although MLT’s results were in line with Maybank’s and consensus estimates, the research team said it is pencilling in slower growth assumptions for the Reit’s China assets. It has cut its DPU estimates by 2 to 3 per cent as a result."

The slight yearly growth in NPI was also seen in some of its segments. Retail earnings grew 0.6 per cent to S$101.8 million, integrated development earnings rose 0.8 per cent to S$72.5 million, while NPI from office earnings held steady at S$74 million.
Gross revenue for the 3 months ended Mar 31 also rose marginally to S$339.7 million, up 1.5 per cent from Q1 2021.
The Reit manager also reported a weighted average lease term of 3.7 years for its properties. By segment, CICT’s retail portfolio WALE is 2 years, while its office and integrated development WALEs are 4 years and 5.4 years respectively.
Its integrated developments also saw an occupancy rise of 1.6 percentage points to 97.6 per cent. However, this was more than offset by its retail and office portfolio occupancies, which fell 0.2 percentage point to 96.6 per cent and a 0.1 percentage point to 91.4 per cent respectively. CICT’s overall portfolio occupancy dropped 0.3 percentage point to 93.6 per cent quarter on quarter.
As Singapore’s Covid-19 measures were further eased on Apr 26, CICT is maintaining a positive business outlook. The Reit manager noted that the unemployment rate declined to 2.7 per cent in 2021 from 3.0 per cent in 2020, while the country’s gross domestic product is expected to grow between 3.0 per cent and 5.0 per cent for 2022."

2022-05-01,Hospitality S-Reits see higher RevPAR as borders reopen,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/hospitality-s-reits-see-higher-revpar-borders-reopen,"TWENTY THREE S-Reits and property trusts have reported financial results or business updates this reporting season. All pure-play hospitality Reits with Singapore assets have reported, and they are: Ascott Residence Trust, : HMN -1.12% CDL Hospitality Trusts, : J85 -1.96% Far East Hospitality Trust, : Q5T -1.68% and Frasers Hospitality Trust. : ACV -1% These 4 averaged 23.4 per cent total returns in the year to date.
Most of the hospitality trusts with Singapore assets reported higher RevPAR (revenue per available room) in Q1 2022, due to growth in average daily rates (ADR) and occupancy. The trusts also expressed optimism for 2022 as they see recovery and reopening across their operating markets.
Ascott Residence Trust noted that several countries saw restrictions tighten in January and February this year while most started to substantially ease border controls towards the end of Q1 2022. It reported a 22 per cent year-on-year increase in portfolio RevPAU (revenue per available unit) from S$55 to S$67 despite the spread of the Omicron variant.
Its longer-stay properties contributed about 28 per cent of Q1 2022 gross profit, up from around 12 per cent in Q1 2021. As more countries reopen borders, the trust noted an uptick in international corporate and leisure bookings. Three of its properties (2 in Singapore, 1 in Australia) also transited from block bookings to welcoming public guests, in line with the respective countries’ reopening plans. In Singapore, its lyf one-north, which obtained TOP in January 2022, also achieved strong occupancy of over 85 per cent in Q1 2022.
CDL Hospitality Trusts recorded RevPAR growth across majority of its portfolio. In Singapore, its Q1 2022 RevPAR rose 40.7 per cent year on year, driven by growth in average room rate. It noted that market demand is recovering, with staycations and corporate project groups still comprising the bulk of demand.

Rental reversion for FY2022 is expected to be in the ""positive low single-digit range"" in view of current market uncertainties, the manager of the real estate investment trust (Reit) said in a quarterly business update on Wednesday (May 4).
The manager also noted that 79.1 per cent of the Reit’s borrowings are on fixed rates with an average term of 3.7 years, though it warned that distribution per unit (DPU) could decline by 0.06 to 0.29 cent if interest rates went up by 20 to 100 basis points.
Occupancy in Singapore held steady at 90 per cent for the first quarter, it said. It noted that the Reit's multi-asset portfolio in Singapore worth S$10 billion comprises properties in the business space and life sciences, logistics, and industrial and data centres segments, allowing it ""to serve a wide range of customers"" across industries.
In addition, the recent completion of several asset enhancement initiatives and redevelopment as part of the Reit’s asset rejuvenation plan are expected to generate higher returns for it, the Reit manager added.
On the other hand, occupancy in Australia fell to 96.8 per cent for the first quarter due to 2 non-renewals upon lease expiry, compared with 99.2 per cent as at end-December 2021."

Tenant sales year-to-date for its 313@somerset mall have also recovered close to FY2020 levels, the manager said in a business update.
Weighted average lease expiry (WALE) by net lettable area (NLA) stood at 8.2 years and 4.3 years by gross rental income (GRI). Moreover, the manager said it ""substantially de-risked"" leases expiring for the year to 1 per cent by NLA and 3 per cent by GRI.
With the completed acquisition of Lendlease Reit's 100 per cent interest in Jem, the manager expects the Reit's WALE to increase to 8.7 years. Its exposure to the suburban retail sector will also expand significantly to about 47 per cent.
For the first quarter, 313@somerset maintained an occupancy rate of 99.4 per cent with a tenant retention rate of 71.1 per cent as at Mar 31. This was mainly due to positive leasing momentum and the manager's ""proactive leasing strategy"".
The manager expects 313@somerset to benefit from the reopening trajectory, amid the resumption of social activities and the launch of the Vaccinated Travel Framework, anticipated to bring tourists back to Singapore."

CDLHT stapled securities were trading 3.7 per cent or S$0.05 lower at the time.
DBS on Friday (May 5) raised its target price on CDLHT to S$1.55 from S$1.40, implying a potential upside of 18.3 per cent. The new target price is 1.15 times the DBS’s net asset value (NAV) estimates, which is 1 standard deviation above its historical trading range.
“We see positives from a multi-year acceleration in revenue per available room (RevPAR), driving price-to-NAV multiples higher, and a 25 per cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in FY2022-24 distribution per unit (DPU),” said DBS analysts Geraldine Wong and Derek Tan.

DBS Group Research, which has a “buy” call on the counter, raised its target price to S$2.70 from S$2.45, as it expects the real estate investment trust (Reit) will post stronger earnings growth in FY2023 as the economy returns to normal.
As the largest commercial Singapore Reit (S-Reit), CICT is likely poised to ride on the retail recovery, as well as the strong upward trajectory in the Singapore office market, the research team said in a report on Thursday (May 5).
It estimated that CICT could deliver a 6 per cent 2-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) which is one of the strongest among peers.
As for Maybank, it expects easing negative retail reversions, improving net property income, as well as tailwinds from the office sector recovery to provide stronger fundamentals for CICT in FY2022.

They look likely to remain a ""safe haven"", on the back of Singapore's reopening story.
The FTSE ST Real Estate Investment Trusts Index (FSTREI) in April dipped 0.8 per cent month on month, compared with a 1.5 per cent decline in the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI).
The outperformance was led by a 7.5 per cent month-on-month gain among hospitality Reits during the month. Hospitality Reits had also surged by 14.4 per cent month on month in March, after Singapore announced the lifting of most Covid-related restrictions.
Singapore Exchange (SGX) market analyst Candace Li noted that S-Reits have managed flattish total returns of just -0.2 per cent in the year to May 6, whereas global Reit hubs reported average declines of close to 10 per cent over the same period.
""Outperformance was mostly led by S-Reits with significant hospitality, retail, and office-related assets based in Singapore, aligned with the country's re-opening theme,"" Li said.
Hospitality trusts Frasers Hospitality Trust (FHT), Far East Hospitality Trust (FEHT), Ascott Residence Trust (ART) and CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT) were among the top 5 performing S-Reits so far this year. Together with Suntec Reit, which has a mixed portfolio of office and retail assets, the top 5 performing S-Reits have averaged 21 per cent returns year to date.

""These are key gateway markets with a lot of liquidity for transactions in the S$200 million to S$400 million range; so you can enter and exit the market fairly quickly,"" said Han Khim Siew, the chief executive officer of OUE Commercial Reit Management. ""The UK and Australia also have very good market transparency and governance.""
The trust is eyeing office properties in those 3 cities (with some supporting retail if any), but it is unlikely to go for pure retail assets, he added. ""Hospitality assets, we will look at selectively.""
While all 7 existing assets of the Reit were from its sponsor, OUE, the overseas assets that the Reit is looking to buy will be third-party acquisitions.
Han also said that ""we want to keep the majority of our asset composition in Singapore"". For the year ended Dec 31, 2021, 90 per cent of OUE C-Reit's revenue was from Singapore.

2022-05-17,Manning the defences: the case for active management and diversification,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/wealth-investing/manning-defences-case-active-management-and-diversification,"THE global economic cycle is currently being impacted by 3 separate shocks: tighter monetary policy, an energy crisis and a Chinese economy whose prospects are clouded by the authorities' zero-Covid policy. As a result, global liquidity is shrinking and leading indicators are pointing towards a rapid economic slowdown.
We have moved beyond a temporary price shock linked to supply issues following the rapid post-Covid economic rebound, with signs of high energy prices seeping into non-energy prices and wages. Despite favourable base effects, global inflation is therefore likely to remain sustained, with pressure now coming from food and services. Lockdowns in China are likely to produce further bottlenecks in global supply chains, adding to inflation in manufacturing inputs. In addition, with European countries considering embargoes on Russian oil imports, energy prices could rebound in the short term.
Oil demand is already declining, however, and the oil market could shift towards slight oversupply in H2 - especially if economic activity weakens. We expect Brent to settle at close to US$95 per barrel by year's end. Anything lower is unlikely as supply capacity remains limited.
The primary aim of most central bankers is to ensure inflation expectations remain anchored. But the risk is growing that they tighten policy too far, pushing economies into recession in the process.
The case for active management
Faced with major geopolitical tensions, a huge commodities shock, high inflation, increasingly aggressive central banks and question marks over China's growth prospects, the stark reality is that investors have few places to hide. Asset allocation has become particularly challenging of late, with negative performances from bonds and equities alike impacting investor sentiment.
But there is some good news: the stock of negative-yielding debt is falling fast, making government bonds look investable again. If we avoid recession and inflation and rate expectations start to subside, equities could at least return to their levels at the start of this year. Moreover, valuations in European, emerging and Asian markets have already declined below the median of the last 20 years - indicating that a large part of negative news has already been priced."

In a filing to the Singapore bourse on Thursday, FLCT said that the purchase price took into consideration an independent valuation of A$60.25 million conducted by consultancy CIVAS (VIC) as at April, 30, 2022. The deal is slated for completion on May 20.
Located at Blackburn Road, Mount Waverley, the building sits in the heart of the City of Monash. Completed in November 2016, the five-storey, A Grade suburban office building has a total net lettable area of 7,297 square metres (sq m) comprising two retail tenancies on the ground level and four upper levels of office space. It is fully leased to nine tenants with a weighted average lease expiry (WALE) of about five years, as at March 31, 2022.
FLCT said the total cost of the building will work out to A$65 million, including stamp duty as well as other fees and expenses linked to the deal.
The acquisition will be funded from the divestment proceeds of Cross Street Exchange in Singapore. In January, FLCT announced the divestment of its remaining leasehold interest in the mixed-use commercial property for S$810.8 million.
Robert Wallace, chief executive officer of the REIT's manager, said: ""With the property being 100 per cent leased to reputable tenants in diverse industries, the acquisition is expected to further enhance FLCT's quality tenant mix and portfolio metrics, while providing unitholders with a stable income stream."""

But even as the crowds return - mostly without masks - to the streets and shopping malls, Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) focused on the US office market are facing a worrisome trend: employees are returning physically to the office more slowly than expected.
Manulife US Reit : BTOU -7.55% recently reported that physical building occupancy averaged just 25.3 per cent for its first quarter ended March. This rose to 34 per cent the month after. While the number is a significant improvement from the 11.1 per cent registered in Q1 a year ago, the physical occupancy figures are still a far cry from the Reit's expectations.
Citing a portfolio-wide survey conducted by Manulife US Reit in 2021, chief investment officer (CIO) Patrick Browne said about 70 per cent of tenants had anticipated they would be back in the office by the end of the year.
""Covid isn't really a thing in the US any more… For restaurants and aeroplanes and everything else, it's not a thing,"" he said at a briefing accompanying the Reit's Q1 2022 operational update. ""(But) it is for office users, I guess.""

Cromwell European Reit reported 94.8 per cent in overall portfolio occupancy and 4.2 per cent positive rent reversion.
Its office portfolio registered positive rent reversion of 1.6 per cent, from several lease renewals and smaller new leases in Italy, France, and Finland. It noted that the preference in Europe trends towards shorter lease durations and flexible leases, while nascent recovery has been tempered by the Ukraine-Russia war which has reduced appetite for office expansions in Finland and Poland.

CapitaLand China Trust (CLCT) reported 24 per cent year-on-year growth in gross revenue for Q1 2022, which in turn contributed to the 30.4 per cent growth in net property income (NPI)."
2022-06-06,Rising appeal of S-Reits as near-term defensive play amid inflation,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/rising-appeal-s-reits-near-term-defensive-play-amid-inflation,"THE regional and global reopening of international borders and domestic economies looks likely to bode well for business and tourism. But market watchers say there are still more headwinds ahead for Singapore stocks.
""(Singapore's) equity market outlook will depend on how well stocks and sectors deal with supply chain disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine war and China's zero Covid-19 policy, uncertainty over the rate of rise in inflation, and the resultant expectations of rapid rises in interest rate hike for the rest of 2022,"" said RHB analyst Shekhar Jaiswal.
Real estate investment trusts (Reits) is one of the defensive sectors that RHB is banking on - alongside the consumer, financials, industrials, transport, and manufacturing and technology sectors - that could potentially benefit from the rising interest rates cycle and provide a foil against rising inflation.
CGS-CIMB analysts Lock Mun Yee and Lim Siew Khee also advocate a ""near-term defensive position in Reits"" amid expectations that the equity market will remain volatile with ""increased external risks"".
""In the near term, with inflation accelerating and interest rates rising, we believe investors would look for downside risk protection as well as for real returns,"" they said.
Lock and Lim note that the Reit sector is trading at a forecast distribution per unit (DPU) yield of around 5.5 per cent for FY2022 - above the 4.2 per cent yield of the benchmark Straits Times Index."
2022-06-07,"As S-Reits leave behind pandemic woes, other headwinds could temper optimism",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/s-reits-leave-behind-pandemic-woes-other-headwinds-could-temper-optimism,"A QUICK glance of headlines surrounding the latest quarterly business updates of Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) for the period ended March would likely imbue investors with much confidence.
An overwhelming majority of S-Reits posted improvements in key metrics from distributable income (DI), distribution per unit (DPU), net property income (NPI) and occupancy rates to rental reversion or revenue per available room (RevPAR).
On the back of such rosy data, it may be tempting to declare that the sector has left the residual sting of the Covid-19 pandemic behind.
While real estate investment trusts (Reits) in the healthcare, hospitality and retail sectors reported performance metrics that were mostly positive, there were, however, some minor blemishes.
For example, Far East Hospitality Trust (FEHT) saw its gross revenue dip 1.6 per cent for the first quarter ended March as a result of the early termination and non-renewal of leases due to its divestment of Central Square.
Average occupancy across FEHT's hotels portfolio also fell 8.4 percentage points to 67.7 per cent in Q1 due to the cessation of the government contract for isolation purposes at 3 of its hotels."
2022-06-09,Asian industrial Reits to continue outperformance: Cushman & Wakefield,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/asian-industrial-reits-continue-outperformance-cushman-wakefield,"INDUSTRIAL Real Estate Investment Trusts (Reits) in Asia-Pacific recorded an annualised total returns of 24.7 per cent on the back of unprecedented growth in e-commerce during the past 3 years. Industrial Reits - which have outperformed hotel, retail and office Reits over the last 10 years - are set to continue their growth, according to Cushman & Wakefield's Asia Reit Market Insight report released on Thursday (Jun 9).
Healthcare Reits recorded an annualised total returns of 22.3 per cent, followed by apartments (19.1 per cent), mixed-use (13.9 per cent) and office (16.1 per cent).
Hotels and retail - investment classes most closely associated with social distancing - recorded 9.4 per cent and 9.8 per cent respectively.
Catherine Chen, director of Asia-Pacific research, said: ""Changes in economic activity have undeniably brought unprecedented challenges to traditional real estate sectors, such as office properties and shopping malls. On the other hand, the surge of activity in the new economy has brought alternative property types such as logistics parks and data centres to the centre of investors' attention.""
Cushman & Wakefield added that Asia's growing middle class, the largest online retail market in the world and increasing intra-regional trade all point to increased industrial activity.
""Even near-term uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment could potentially increase demand for logistics assets in the region, as operators accumulate reserves of warehouse space to hedge against supply chain disruption,"" it reported.
That said, the report highlighted that changes in manufacturing and technology will lead to greater demand for higher-spec assets, such that the best performing Reits will be those that continually improve their properties.
Dennis Yeo, head of investor services and logistics and industrial in Asia-Pacific, said: ""Industrial facilities now need to be different from facilities 10 years ago. If logistics operators are using drones and autonomous vehicles for deliveries, facilities need homing devices and charging points. Reits must continue to regenerate their portfolios, either through investing in technology or through disposal and acquisition.""
At the close of 2021 there were 198 Reits in Asia, with a total market value of US$304.1 billion, up by 8.1 per cent year on year. Japan accounted for nearly half of the total value of the Asia Reit market, while Singapore made up the second largest at 28.1 per cent.
Of the 198 Reits, 89 were mixed-use, 30 were focused on the office market, 25 were in industrial or logistics properties, 24 were in retail, 17 in the hotel sector, 7 in healthcare, 4 in multifamily and 2 in data centres.

Last year, 2 new Reits were listed on the Singapore Exchange, namely Daiwa House Logistics Trust : DHLU 0% and Digital Core Reit : DCRU +0.99%. Altogether, Singapore-listed Reits (S-Reits) had a market value of US$85.31 billion. In 2021, 24 S-Reits also announced acquisitions for a total market value of more than S$15.3 billion.

The highest returns seen in the market was from First Reit : AW9U 0%, which achieved a total return of 56.6 per cent.

Dividend yield for S-Reits was about 6.1 per cent last year, 0.3 percentage point lower than that in 2020.
The average price-to-book (PB) ratio of S-Reits was 1.01 as at initial public offer. As at the end of 2021, the average PB ratio was 1, which means the trading price of Singapore Reits on the secondary market was basically equivalent to book net assets.
Reits in Hong Kong had a PB ratio of 0.54, as border closure brought about by the pandemic ""greatly impacted"" their trading prices, Cushman & Wakefield noted. Meanwhile, Japan Reits traded at a premium last year, with a PB ratio of 1.14. Cushman & Wakefield added that the ratios of Reits in Asia are generally lower than that in the US, which saw a median PB ratio of 1.7 in 2021."

2022-06-12,Healthcare S-Reits see stable growth and resilience,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/healthcare-s-reits-see-stable-growth-and-resilience,"SINGAPORE lists 2 actively traded Healthcare related S-Reits - ParkwayLife Reit and First Reit. Healthcare Reits invest in income-producing real estate primarily used for healthcare related purposes including but not limited to hospitals, medical offices, outpatient facilities and nursing facilities. As such, these Reits may be regarded as an option for investors to gain exposure to the growing and resilient healthcare sector.
ParkwayLife Reit is one of the largest listed healthcare Reits in Asia with a portfolio of 56 properties at S$2.29 billion in size. It has 64.6 per cent of its portfolio in hospitals and medical centres, and 35.4 per cent in nursing homes, across Singapore (64.3 per cent), Japan (35.4 per cent), and Malaysia (0.3 per cent).
ParkwayLife Reit reported 2.3 per cent year-on-year higher gross revenue for Q1 2022, arising from the3 properties it acquired last year and higher rent received from Singapore hospitals. The Reit noted that its distribution per unit (DPU) has grown steadily at a rate of 122.8 per cent since its listing.
In its Singapore portfolio (hospitals include Mouth Elizabeth Hospital, Parkway East Hospital, and Gleneagles Hospital), its master lessee Parkway Hospitals Singapore, is a wholly owned subsidiary of IHH Health which is one of the world's largest healthcare networks with 80 hospitals in 10 countries. Its latest renewal term of 20.4 years runs from Aug 23, 2022 to Dec 31, 2042, with an option to renew for a further 10 years. It has a triple net lease arrangement which means that the Reit does not bear property taxes, property insurance, property operating expenses and is unaffected by inflated-related escalating expenses.
In its Japan portfolio, it owns 52 nursing home properties with a weighted average lease term to expiry of 11.79 years and a diversified tenant base across 28 nursing home operators. Based on its existing lease arrangements, about 95.2 per cent of its Japan portfolio is downside-protected.
First Reit has a portfolio of 31 properties comprising 16 in Indonesia, 3 in Singapore and 12 in Japan with a combined size exceeding S$1.2 billion. Its Reit manager is 60 per cent owned by OUE Limited and 40 per cent owned by OUE Lippo Healthcare (OUELH). As such, the Reit has rights-of-first refusal to a pipeline of properties from PT Lippo Karawaci Tbk and OUELH.
First Reit in its Q1 2022 business update reported 34.9 per cent year-on-year growth in net property and other income and 1.5 per cent growth in DPU paid (0.66 Singapore cents for Q1 2022). Following its maiden entry into Japan with the acquisition of 12 nursing homes, First Reit noted that it has successfully taken the first step of its First Reit 2.0 Growth Strategy to expand into developed markets and diversify geographical risk.
First Reit's Indonesia hospital operator, PT Siloam International Hospitals Tbk reported stable quarter-on-quarter performance for Q1 2022 despite the impact of the Omicron variant. First Reit's nursing homes in Japan and Singapore also noted high occupancy rates and the Reit remains confident of the resilient healthcare market in its operating markets."
2022-06-13,Frasers Property to privatise FHT at S$0.70 per stapled security,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/frasers-property-privatise-fht-s070-stapled-security,"FRASERS Property Hospitality Trust Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Frasers Property : TQ5 +0.61%, is proposing to privatise Frasers Hospitality Trust : ACV 0% (FHT) through a trust scheme of arrangement.

The privatisation will shave over S$1.3 billion worth of value from the local bourse.

The offeror is proposing to acquire all of FHT's stapled securities - other than those held by TCC Group Investments and Frasers Property and its subsidiaries - at a scheme consideration of S$0.70 each in cash, it said in a bourse filing on Monday (Jun 13).
The scheme consideration represents a premium of 43.8 per cent over the 12-month volume-weighted average price per stapled security up to and including Apr 7, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of its strategic review, and a premium of 16.7 per cent over recent analyst consensus of the counter's target price in 2022.

It also implies a price to net asset value (NAV) multiple of 1.07 times, which is above historical averages of FHT's trading multiples since its initial public offering (IPO), current trading multiples of other listed Singapore hospitality trusts, and precedent Singapore real estate investment trust (Reit) privatisations.

For investors that have stayed with FHT from its inception in 2014, however, the scheme consideration represents a steep 20.5 per cent drop from its IPO price of S$0.88.
In a press briefing accompanying the announcement, Eu Chin Fen, chief executive of FHT's managers, noted that the Reit has achieved a total return of 22.7 per cent since its IPO.

""For stapled securityholders who have invested in FHT IPO and subscribed for our rights (issues), this is actually a higher return than 2 out of 3 of FHT peers over the same period,"" Eu said. ""Our total return is not great but is not much worse off than our peers.""

The managers noted that from Jul 14, 2014, to Jun 8, 2022, hospitality peer Ascott Residence Trust has recorded a total return of 48.9 per cent, while CDL Hospitality Trusts and Far East Hospitality Trust saw total returns of 20.7 per cent and 7.9 per cent, respectively.

The managers of FHT said it faced obstacles in growing the hospitality Reit's distribution per stapled security and net asset value amid muted growth within the hospitality sectors of the markets FHT operates in, as well as the strengthening of the Singapore dollar against FHT's operational currencies.

Portfolio valuation gains, it said, had been offset by foreign exchange losses, with operational currencies weakening by some 10 per cent since FHT's IPO.

""When we started out, we definitely had aspirations to grow… to be a meaningful player in the market,"" Eu said. ""We tried our best, we did our best and we stayed committed throughout the journey… (But) operating markets where most of our assets are in have been challenging and growth has really been muted.""

More recently, Eu said the Russia-Ukraine war has compounded existing pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions, which has led to increases in commodity, food and energy prices.

This, in turn, has ""triggered very high inflation"", she added.

""All this increase in costs means that interest rates will continue to rise, and this will add to heightened recessionary pressure,"" Eu said. ""What this means for our hospitality business, essentially, is that it will add both topline and bottomline pressures to our business.""

""Again, further strengthening of the Singapore dollar could potentially limit any revelation gains and distribution per stapled security growth,"" she added. ""Amid the uncertainties, it is likely that the Singapore dollar will continue to strengthen, and this does not bode well for our operating performance and NAV.""

Further, the managers of FHT said its small size as compared to its peers has limited its ability to reap the benefits of a continued listing.

""If we were to talk about growing ourselves to be meaningful to be included in an index, this will need us to grow by a float size of S$1.8 billion, which will be a challenge for us,"" Eu said. ""What this means is that we will likely continue to struggle with low liquidity.""

She added: ""We believe that the proposed trust scheme is the best option and represents a credible opportunity for our stapled securityholders to realise their investments at an attractive valuation.""

Loo Choo Leong, group chief financial officer of Frasers Property - the sponsor of FHT - said the transaction will allow the group to increase its investment in hospitality assets in locations it is already familiar with.

""Hospitality remains core to our businesses,"" Loo said.

""We are cognisant of the prevailing factors that may negatively impact the recovery trajectory of the hospitality sector and, consequently, the pre-Covid-19 valuation of FHT assets,"" he added. ""Having said that, as with all real estate sectors, there are up cycles and down cycles. Frasers Property takes a long-term view of the returns from our investments, and we remain cautiously optimistic about the long-term growth potential of the hospitality sector.""

The independent directors of FHT noted that the scheme is the best option given that it represents a credible offer from a financial perspective, offers strong deal certainty for stapled securityholders in terms of timing and execution, and allows stapled securityholders to realise their investment at an attractive valuation immediately.

On Apr 8, the managers of FHT announced it was undergoing a strategic review to enhance and unlock value for its stapled securityholders. It had explored options including continuing FHT's existing strategy, expansion of the existing FHT platform via acquisitions or mergers, strategic sale of all or select assets, and the sale of the FHT platform to a third-party or the sponsor.

The scheme will require the necessary regulatory and court approvals, and is subject to approval by stapled securityholders.

DBS is the financial adviser to the FHT managers for the acquisition and the scheme. Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch (Singapore) is the lead financial adviser and OCBC is the financial adviser to the offeror.

Stapled securities of FHT jumped 4.6 per cent or S$0.03 higher to close at S$0.69 on Monday, following the announcement, while shares of Frasers Property closed 1.8 per cent or S$0.02 lower at S$1.08."
2022-06-15,Proposal for Frasers Property to take hospitality trust private may raise expectations for sponsors,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/proposal-frasers-property-take-hospitality-trust-private-may-raise,"SOME investors will almost certainly gripe about not being offered a high enough price. And, there could be some hand-wringing about the local market losing good listings because of pitifully low valuations.
Yet, the proposed privatisation of Frasers Hospitality Trust : ACV 0% (FHT) by its sponsor group is a positive development for holders of its stapled securities as well as Singapore's real estate investment trust (Reit) sector.
On Jun 13, Frasers Property : TQ5 +0.61% (FPL) said it plans to take FHT private at S$0.70 per stapled security.
The announcement of the deal included a frank acknowledgement that FHT - which owns 14 assets across 9 cities in Asia, Australia and Europe - has failed to perform well.

Despite a series of acquisitions and asset enhancement initiatives, FHT's net asset value (NAV) and distributions per stapled security (DPS) have been in a steady decline - even before the pandemic began.

This translated to a weak market valuation. Since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2014, FHT had traded at an average discount to its NAV of 19 per cent. Over the 3-year period to Apr 7, FHT traded at an even bigger discount to NAV of 25 per cent.
From its IPO until 2019 - before Covid-19 began - FHT traded at a relatively high average DPS yield of 7.2 per cent. Its hospitality peers traded at a yield of 6.4 per cent.

To their credit, FHT's managers and sponsor group have chosen to do something about this languishing Reit. And, they are taking a course of action that involves the sponsor group coming up with a significant amount of cash.

Stumping up cash
On Apr 8, the managers of FHT said they were reviewing strategic options to enhance and unlock value.

The market price of FHT's stapled securities had begun a steep ascent in March, in tandem with peers Ascott Residence Trust (ART) and CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT).

Informing the market of the value unlocking intentions arguably helped FHT's price stay aloft and ensure that market expectations were factored into decisions that followed.

FHT's managers explored continuing with their existing strategy; expanding the FHT platform via acquisitions or mergers; pursuing a strategic sale of its assets; and the sale of the FHT platform to a third-party or its own sponsor.

Under the proposal to take FHT private, FPL will acquire all its stapled securities other than those it and TCC Group Investments currently hold.

TCC holds more than 707.3 million (or 36.7 per cent) of FHT's total outstanding 1.9 billion stapled securities. FHT holds almost 497 million (or 25.8 per cent) of FHT's stapled securities.

At S$0.70 each, the nearly 721.8 million FHT stapled securities that FPL plans to acquire will cost it S$505.3 million.

The money FPL is stumping up will enable long-suffering holders of FHT's stapled securities to cash out at 1.07 times book value. Investors who bought FHT's stapled securities at its IPO in 2014 and subscribed to its rights issue in 2016 would walk away with a total return of 22.7 per cent.

Over the same period, ART returned 48.9 per cent. CDLHT and Far East Hospitality Trust (FEHT) returned 20.7 per cent and 7.9 per cent, respectively.
Giving investors choices
This does not necessarily mean holders of FHT's stapled securities should vote in favour of the deal, though.
FPL would not be taking FHT private if it did not see significant value in the Reit - even at S$0.70 per stapled security.
With the pandemic receding, some investors may be betting that FHT's market value will continue to improve. During most of 2018 and 2019, FHT's stapled securities traded north of S$0.70.
Some long-term investors might also be upset that FPL is paying less than FHT's IPO price of S$0.88.
Nevertheless, the proposal currently on the table gives investors choices they did not previously have. They can vote in favour of the deal and eventually collect S$0.70 per stapled security, or vote against the proposal and hold on.
Alternatively, they can take advantage of FHT's currently elevated market price - it closed at S$0.70 on Tuesday (Jun 14) - to immediately get out and hunt for alternative opportunities amid the current sell-off.
Raising the bar
The larger point is the proposal to take FHT private might come to be viewed as a playbook of sorts for how sponsor groups should reposition a failing Reit.
Over the past few years, sponsor groups have merged Reits within their stables to enlarge them and widen their investor following. But these transactions came under fire for being unfair to unitholders of one Reit or the other.
More than 2 years ago, some unitholders of Frasers Commercial Trust felt they were getting the short end of the stick in its merger with Frasers Logistics & Industrial Trust.
FPL seemed content to stay out of the fray, though. And, it wasn't the only one.
When ESR Cayman and Ara Asset Management merged, they left it to ESR-Reit and Ara Logos Logistics Trust to organise their own merger to solve the problem of their overlapping mandates.
At one point, investors were told the combined sponsor group might sell the manager of one of the Reits if they failed to merge - a move that would have created a lot of uncertainty for unitholders.
Mapletree Investments set a precedent with its hands-on approach in quelling investor discontent with the merger of Mapletree Commercial Trust (MCT) and Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust (MNACT).
It underwrote a S$2.2 billion preferential offering by MCT to make it possible for minority unitholders of MNACT to receive their consideration in cash instead of new MCT units.
FPL's decision to offer investors an opportunity to cash out of FHT at a premium to book value may now further raise the bar, and investors may soon look askance at sponsor groups of Reits that do not garner decent market valuations.
Prominent Singapore-listed Reits currently trading at discounts of more than 20 per cent to book value include CapitaLand China Trust, Starhill Global Reit, FEHT, IReit Global and United Hampshire US Reit.
The capacity and willingness to offer investors generous cash exits from their failing Reits ought to be a hallmark of a ""good"" sponsor."
2022-06-19,Merger of MCT and MNACT creates pathway for growth,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/merger-mct-and-mnact-creates-pathway-growth,"THE ongoing merger of Mapletree Commercial Trust (MCT) : N2IU +0.74%and Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust (MNACT) : RW0U 0% is on track to create one of the top 10 largest Reits in Asia.
The merged entity, Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust (MPACT) will have an estimated market capitalisation of over S$10 billion and will hold a diversified portfolio of 18 commercial assets across Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea, with assets under management (AUM) of approximately S$17.1 billion.
The Reit managers believe that the merger will provide a pathway for growth by merging MCT, a Singapore-focused Reit, with MNACT, a ready and established platform that has scale and reach in North Asia.
MCT said that this will in turn bring about immediate financial benefits and access to attractive footholds into North Asia supported by established local operating teams with extensive experience and a strong track record.
Other key benefits cited by the Reits include enhanced financial flexibility to pursue more growth opportunities such as larger acquisitions and capital recycling opportunities, increased liquidity and index representation, enhanced geographic diversification, reduced single asset concentration and improved tenant diversification as well as immediate financial benefits in terms of distribution per unit (DPU) and net asset value (NAV) accretion on a historical pro forma basis.
Post-merger, MPACT will hold best-in-class assets such as Festival Walk in Hong Kong, Mapletree Business City and VivoCity in Singapore.
The Reit managers believe that together, these will improve overall cash flow stability and resilience through market cycles.
MPACT will host major tenants with global businesses such as Google, BMW, Seiko, HP Japan and NTT UD.
Together, the top 10 tenants by gross rental income (GRI) will contribute 23 per cent of its GRI post-merger. This is down from MCT's 27.7 per cent and MNACT's 37.7 per cent, reducing income concentration.
Unitholders of MCT and MNACT have voted in favour of the merger last month.
The merger will be effected through the acquisition by MCT of all the issued and paid-up units of MNACT by way of a trust scheme of arrangement.
During the election period, each MNACT unitholder is entitled to choose only one form of scheme consideration: scrip-only, cash-and-scrip or cash-only options. The cash-only consideration will be the default form of the scheme consideration.
Based on indicative dates announced by the Reit managers, the election period is expected to run from Jun 15 to 29 while the merged entity is expected to begin trading on Jul 29.
MNACT's estimated date of delisting will be on Aug 3."
2022-06-20,Fed rate hikes spell trouble for investors,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/fed-rate-hikes-spell-trouble-investors,"THERE is no easy way to say this. Everything is going to fall, and there is really nowhere to hide.

The US Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening and interest rate hikes are weighing down global asset prices across the risk spectrum, and may well trigger pockets of instability in some corners of the market. Meanwhile, the value of cash is being eroded by inflation.

Big sell-offs are generally good buying opportunities for long-term investors, but getting inflation under control could mean a lengthy period of tighter monetary policy and a recession - which would cloud the outlook for corporate earnings for some time.
Investors should also be wary of excessive valuations garnered by some companies during the pandemic, when governments unleashed aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus. As interest rates rise, forecasts of strong earnings far in the future are likely to be much less potent drivers of stock prices.

Over the last few months, it has become increasingly clear that accelerating inflation is not being caused by transient supply chain bottlenecks alone.

US unemployment came in at 3.6 per cent for the third month in a row in May, with some 6 million people unemployed. These economic indicators are now very close to where they were before the pandemic suddenly halted economic activity.
Back in February 2020, US unemployment was running at 3.5 per cent with some 5.7 million people unemployed.

This data suggests that strong demand has been a significant factor behind accelerating US inflation - and that tighter monetary policy is now required.

In fact, after consumer price data on June 10 showed inflation in May had accelerated to 8.6 per cent - up from 8.3 per cent in April and 7 per cent in December - the market began to anticipate that the Fed would hike the federal funds rate by more than the 50 basis points it had previously indicated.

On June 15, the Fed raised the federal funds rate by 75 basis points to 1.5-1.75 per cent - its biggest hike in nearly 3 decades.

The Fed is now also reversing its quantitative easing policy. Since Jun 1, it has been allowing principal payments of its securities holdings to roll off its balance sheet at the rate of US$47.5 billion per month. The pace of this roll-off will double in September to US$95 billion per month.

The impact of these moves by the Fed is now being felt by investors across the globe. Since the beginning of June, the S&P 500 has fallen 11.1 per cent while the Nasdaq 100 has declined 10.9 per cent.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are now 22.9 per cent and 31 per cent lower, respectively, than they were at the beginning of the year - more than the 20 per cent threshold that marks a bear market.

Closer to home, the Straits Times Index (STI) held up better. It has slipped almost 4.2 per cent since the beginning of June. Year to date, the local benchmark index is down 0.8 per cent.

Protracted market pressure
Some investors may feel the urge to jump into the market now. And, there may indeed be some bargains to be had. My own view, however, is that markets are likely to remain under pressure for some time.

Bear markets tend to end when central banks begin loosening monetary policy. For now, the Fed seems to be a long way from that inflection point.

Median projections by the Federal Open Market Committee participants put the midpoint of the federal funds rate at 3.375 per cent by the end of 2022 - suggesting the federal funds rate could more than double over the next 6 months.

As interest rates rise, economic growth projections and corporate earnings forecasts are likely to be revised down - casting a cloud of uncertainty over stock valuations.

It is also worth putting the recent stock market sell-off in perspective. Even after its steep year-to-date decline, the S&P 500 is still more than 13 per cent higher than it was at the beginning of 2020.

This is partly because of strong recent gains in energy stocks. But it also reflects the trajectory of the big technology-oriented stocks that were widely viewed to have been impervious to - or even beneficiaries of - the pandemic.

For instance, Apple is down 25.9 per cent since the beginning of the year but it is 81.6 per cent higher than it was at the beginning of 2020.

Similarly, Alphabet and Microsoft have declined 26 per cent and 26.4 per cent this year. But they are still 58.2 per cent and 55.8 per cent higher than they were at the beginning of 2020.

Facebook and Netflix have taken more severe beatings, falling 51.3 per cent and 70.9 per cent this year, respectively. Facebook is now 21.3 per cent lower than it was at the start of 2020 while Netflix is down 46.7 per cent.

It remains to be seen whether the declines suffered so far by these heavyweight technology stocks - and, consequently, the S&P 500 - have fully offset their overvaluation during the pandemic and discounted the possibility of a recession.

Banks, Reits struggling
By contrast, the STI is 4.1 per cent below where it was at the beginning of 2020 despite holding up better than the S&P 500 this year.

Yet, the local market benchmark could be vulnerable in the months ahead.

In the first place, 7 of its 30 components are real estate investment trusts (Reits), which are susceptible to rising interest rates.

Moreover, some industrial property Reits - including Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust, Mapletree Logistics Trust, Mapletree Industrial Trust and Keppel DC Reit - had garnered premium valuations during the pandemic that are now eroding.

On a year-to-date basis, only 1 out of the 7 Reits that are components of the STI has charted a gain - namely CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (up 5.9 per cent).

Of the 6 that have fallen since the beginning of the year, 4 of them have recorded double-digit percentage declines - namely, Frasers L&C Trust (down 12.5 per cent), Keppel DC Reit (down 21.3 per cent), Mapletree Commercial Trust (down 11.5 per cent) and Mapletree Logistics Trust (down 13.2 per cent).

Then, there are the 3 local banks - which account for nearly half the STI.

This column noted a fortnight ago that DBS, OCBC and UOB are widely seen to be beneficiaries of rising interest rates and were leading the STI higher early this year. But amid growing concern that curbing inflation might mean slower economic growth, the banks have rolled back.
DBS - which trades at the highest premium to book value by far - has fallen 8.5 per cent so this year. OCBC and UOB are almost flat year to date.
Until the Fed's anti-inflation campaign runs its course, investors should tread carefully."
2022-06-21,Frasers Hospitality Trust falls to a confluence of headwinds – are more S-Reits at risk?,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/frasers-hospitality-trust-falls-confluence-headwinds-are-more-s-reits-risk,"JUST a month shy of 8 years since its initial public offering (IPO), the managers of Frasers Hospitality Trust (FHT) are ready to call it quits.

FHT on Jun 13 announced a proposed privatisation by its sponsor group. Under the scheme of arrangement, the offeror - a wholly owned subsidiary of real estate giant Frasers Property Limited (FPL) - will pay S$0.70 in cash for each FHT stapled security that FPL and TCC Group Investments do not already hold.

The managers of FHT were candid about their reasons for the proposed privatisation, which comes 2 months after the Singapore-listed real estate investment trust (S-Reit) announced a strategic review.
Among other things, FHT's managers cited the strengthening of the Singapore dollar (SGD) against the local currencies in overseas markets in which the trust operates - Australia, Japan, Malaysia, the UK and Europe.

Together with muted growth in the hospitality sector in these markets, the managers said foreign exchange pressures prevented FHT from growing its distribution per stapled security (DPS) and net asset value (NAV) in SGD terms.

It added that geopolitical tension and looming recessionary pressures have cast uncertainty over the recovery outlook, while an expected further strengthening of the SGD could potentially limit any revaluation gains and DPS growth.
Furthermore, the managers of FHT said its small size compared to its S-Reit peers limits its ability to reap the benefits of a continued listing.

It noted that trading liquidity has been hamstrung as it has not been included in major stock market indices. This has limited its flexibility in undertaking asset acquisitions for growth, the managers added.

Before the proposed privatisation fuelled a 4.6 per cent jump in stapled securities of FHT to close at S$0.69 on the day of the announcement - near the price to NAV of 1.07 times in the scheme consideration - the Reit had grappled with weak market valuation.

Since its IPO, it had traded at an average discount of 19 per cent to its NAV. Over the 3-year period to Apr 7 - the day before it announced its strategic review - the Reit traded at a discount to NAV of 25 per cent.

FHT, of course, is not alone in facing these challenges. Could other S-Reits that face similar issues be at risk of leaving the market?

Citi research analyst Brandon Lee noted that FHT will be the 8th Reit or business trust in the Singapore market to undergo a privatisation or buyout, including the ongoing SPH Reit deal. There have been 7 Reit mergers, including the ongoing merger between Mapletree Commercial Trust (MCT) and Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust (MNACT).

""From a broader sector perspective, we think this (proposed privatisation of FHT) and its rationale could result in a deeper consideration or evaluation by sponsors managing S-Reits which are currently trading at deep discounts of their longer-term strategy of their Reits,"" Lee said in a recent flash note. ""Asset under management (AUM) growth becomes increasingly challenging in the face of the rising cost of capital, especially for the smaller ones.""

In turn, Lee said, the lack of growth could lower investor interest in those Reits.

As at Jun 20, 4 S-Reits - Dasin Retail Trust, EC World Reit, Lippo Malls Indonesia Retail Trust (LMIRT) and BHG Retail Reit - are trading at massive discounts of at least 40 per cent to NAV.

Like FHT, all 4 are at the mercy of foreign exchange fluctuations as their assets are mainly based overseas.

The quartet, though, are far smaller than FHT, with market capitalisations of between just S$228 million and S$433 million.

Another baker's dozen - OUE Commercial Reit, Starhill Global Reit, ARA US Hospitality Trust, Aims Apac Reit (AA Reit), CapitaLand China Trust (CLCT), First Reit, Far East Hospitality Trust (FEHT), Sasseur Reit, IReit Global, Suntec Reit, Cromwell European Reit, Prime US Reit and United Hamphire US Reit - are also trading at discounts to NAV of 20 per cent or more.

About half of these Reits are focused mainly on properties outside Singapore. Nearly half also have market caps of under S$1 billion.

The final ingredient to spice up the potential for a privatisation, buyout or merger could be the presence of a strong sponsor.

Notably, the proposed privatisation of FHT will see FPL fork out some S$505.3 million in cash.

Meanwhile, Mapletree Investments - the sponsor of both MCT and MNACT - stepped in to support the merger by agreeing to stump up as much as S$2.2 billion in cash to quell investor discontent.

The privately held unit of Temasek underwrote a S$2.2 billion preferential offering by MCT to make it possible for minority unitholders of MNACT to receive their consideration in cash instead of new MCT units.

With several big-name sponsors backing some of the S-Reits that are struggling with the same challenges that FHT has cited, it would not be surprising to see more such corporate action on the cards."
2022-06-21,"Brokers’ take: Analysts bump Keppel DC Reit targets on acquisitions, attractive yield",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/brokers-take-analysts-bump-keppel-dc-reit-targets-acquisitions-attractive-yield,"ANALYSTS have raised their targets on Keppel DC Reit : AJBU -0.49% after factoring in recent acquisitions and attractive forward yields.
DBS Group Research on Tuesday (Jun 21) raised its target price on the data centre real estate investment trust (Reit) to S$2.50 from S$2.40 after revising its distribution per unit (DPU) estimates.
The research team noted that Keppel DC Reit is generating a ""very attractive"" forward yield of more than 5.2 per cent. It maintained its ""buy"" recommendation on the counter.
DBS's new target price of S$2.50 represents a potential upside of 28.9 per cent from the counter's trading price of S$1.94 as at 10.37 am on Tuesday. Keppel DC Reit was up 1.6 per cent or S$0.03 at the time.
Meanwhile, CGS-CIMB raised its target price slightly by S$0.01 to S$2.63, which represents a potential upside of 35.6 per cent. It maintained its ""add"" call on the counter.
The bump in target price came after the research team raised its FY2022-24 DPU estimates by 0.7-3.21 per cent, after factoring in contributions from Keppel DC Reit's new acquisitions.
On Monday, the Reit manager announced that Keppel DC Reit will acquire 2 data centres in Guangdong, China, for a total price of about 1.6 billion yuan (S$338.3 million). These acquisitions are expected to be DPU-accretive.
""Just as we had turned cautious and lowered our acquisition assumptions for Keppel DC Reit, it has surprised on the upside by delivering 2 acquisitions in Guangdong, China,"" said DBS analysts Dale Lai and Derek Tan.
Keppel DC Reit's ability to embark on the acquisition was surprising given record-low yields among data centres globally, they said. They added that the attractive 8 per cent yield from the acquisition would help drive DPU accretion over the next 3 years.
DBS expects the acquisitions to be 2.6 per cent accretive to the Reit's DPU, even after factoring a potential equity fundraising (estimated at S$90 million) by Q3 2023 to fund the remaining payment for one of the Guangdong data centres.

Moreover, the acquisitions should add to earnings, on top of organic growth within the Reit's existing portfolio, Lai and Tan said.

Separately, CGS-CIMB noted that Keppel DC Reit is trading at a projected 5.3 per cent FY2022 dividend yield following its recent unit price decline. It believes the longer-term demand for data centres will remain intact and underpin the Reit's income resilience in the long term.

Units of Keppel DC Reit ended Tuesday at S$1.93, up 1.1 per cent or S$0.02.

2022-06-21,"Nearly 2 in 3 S-Reits are faring worse than at IPO, but total returns mostly positive",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/nearly-2-3-s-reits-are-faring-worse-ipo-total-returns-mostly-positive,"INVESTORS in Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) may be understandably upset as they look at their portfolio performance.
Real estate investment trusts (Reits) have been a favoured asset class for investors here seeking stability and yield. But ahead of the 20th anniversary of S-Reits coming up in July, nearly two-thirds of the 41 actively traded S-Reits and property trusts have sunk below their initial public offering (IPO) prices after adjusting for corporate actions.
Notably, all but 4 of the 22 S-Reits that listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) over the past decade since 2012 are below where they started, according to data compiled by The Business Times..
Keppel DC Reit has been the outperformer among the newer listings, more than doubling from its IPO price of S$0.93 in December 2014.
With dividends reinvested, the data centre landlord has managed a total return of 194.5 per cent. This translates to an annualised total return of 15.5 per cent - the second-highest among the S-Reits.
Another S-Reit listing within the past 10 years that has been a standout performer is Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (FLCT), which made its trading debut as Frasers Logistics & Industrial Trust (FLT) in June 2016 before merging with Frasers Commercial Trust (FCOT) in 2020.
After adjusting for corporate action, FLCT is trading 47.3 per cent above its IPO price of S$0.89, with a total return of 110.8 per cent and an annualised total return of 13.3 per cent.

The only other 2 more recent S-Reit listings that are trading above their IPO prices are Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust (MNACT) and SPH Reit.

However, investors can take comfort from the fact that only 8 of the 41 actively traded S-Reits have failed to deliver positive total returns since listing.

These include 5 S-Reits - ARA US Hospitality Trust, Prime US Reit, United Hampshire US Reit, Daiwa House Logistics Trust and Digital Core Reit - that listed within the past 3 years since 2019.

These S-Reits may require more time to stabilise, as they have had to grapple with the Covid-19 pandemic and a confluence of macroeconomic headwinds since listing.

The other 3 S-Reits that have generated negative total returns since their listings are Lippo Malls Indonesia Retail Trust, BHG Retail Reit and Dasin Retail Trust.

Interestingly, all 8 of these underperforming S-Reits are focused on overseas assets outside of Singapore.

Further, the data seems to suggest that, when it comes to S-Reits, old is gold.

The first 2 Reits to be listed in Singapore in 2002, CapitaLand Mall Trust (CMT) and Ascendas Reit, rank among the top performers in the market.

CMT, which was renamed CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT) following the 2020 merger with CapitaLand Commercial Trust (CCT), owns and invests in retail and office assets located predominantly in Singapore.

The largest proxy for Singapore commercial real estate, some 93 per cent of CICT's S$22.9 billion property portfolio is based in Singapore, with the remaining 7 per cent in Germany and Australia.

From its IPO price of S$0.98 in July 2020, CICT has seen its unit price jump 173.1 per cent, after adjusting for corporate action. With dividends reinvested, this translates to a total return of 643.3 per cent since its listing, or an annualised total return of 10.6 per cent.

Ascendas Reit, which is also under the CapitaLand umbrella, has a portfolio that includes business spaces, logistics and distribution centres, industrial properties and data centres.

As at end March, the Reit's investment properties under management stood at S$16.4 billion, with 61 per cent located in Singapore and the remainder in the US, Australia, the UK and Europe.

Ascendas Reit is trading at more than triple its IPO price, with a total return of 958.6 per cent since its inception - the highest in the S-Reit universe.

Certainly, their sheer size could have played a part in their success. CICT and Ascendas Reit are the 2 largest S-Reits, with market capitalisations of S$14.1 billion and S$11.6 billion, respectively, as of June 16.
Another case in point is Mapletree Logistics Trust (MLT), which also ranks among the biggest S-Reits with a market cap of S$7.8 billion.

Listed in July 2005 at an IPO price of S$0.68, MLT is now trading nearly 2-and-a-half times higher. It has managed a total return of 620.5 per cent since its listing, or an annualised total return of 12.4 per cent.

But other smaller ""old-timers"" have performed remarkably as well.

For example, Suntec Reit, which made its trading debut in December 2004, has seen its unit price grow 67 per cent, with a total return of 401.5 per cent or an annualised total return of 9.6 per cent.

Other standout performers in the S-Reit market include Frasers Centrepoint Trust (FCT), Parkway Life Reit, Mapletree Industrial Trust (MIT) and Mapletree Commercial Trust (MCT), which have generated annualised total returns of between 11 per cent to 15.6 per cent."

The iEdge S-Reit Index maintained resilience with a 2 per cent decline in total returns, while the FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index (a benchmark for global Reits) declined 15 per cent.

For the quarter-to-date, Singapore stocks have seen S$1.05 billion of net institutional outflows, reducing the 2022 year-to-date (YTD) net institutional inflow to S$74 million.

The technology sector has continued to weigh on global stocks, with hospitality and real estate also lagging. Banks, technology, and Reits have now booked the most net institutional outflows across the sectors in 2022 YTD. In the YTD, STI's total returns have maintained at 1 per cent and iEdge S-Reit Index has declined 0.8 per cent. The FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index declined 18 per cent in the YTD.

From an SGX Research market update last week, the 20 stocks among the most actively traded Singapore stocks that booked the highest net institutional inflows in the YTD proportionate to their current market capitalisation included 5 S-Reits. These 20 stocks averaged 22 per cent total returns in the YTD. The 5 S-Reits were Ascott Residence Trust, : HMN -1.12% Suntec Reit, : T82U -1.72% CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust, : C38U 0% Frasers Hospitality Trust, : ACV 0% and Keppel Reit : K71U 0%. These 5 S-Reits averaged 18 per cent total returns in the YTD and saw combined net institutional inflows exceeding S$300 million.

Over the past 5 trading sessions through to Jun 23, institutional investors were net buyers of Singapore stocks with S$116 million of net inflows, following S$166 million in net outflows for the preceding 5 sessions. The top 5 stocks with the highest net institutional inflows were DBS, : D05 -0.62% Singtel, : Z74 0% CapitaLand Investment : 9CI -0.33%, Digital Core Reit : DCRU +0.99% and Hongkong Land : H78 0%.

Digital Core Reit in its Q1 2022 business update reported a 2 per cent increase in distributable income versus its IPO forecast. In April 2022, Digital Core Reit's fifth-largest customer, a privately held IT service provider in Toronto, filed for bankruptcy protection. The Reit manager expects to be able to back-fill this capacity, given the tight market conditions in Toronto and updated that the customer event is not expected to impact distribution per unit.
In terms of director acquisitions over the past week, United Hampshire US Reit (UHReit) Management's non-independent non-executive director David Tuvia Goss on Jun 20 and 22 acquired 500,000 units of UHReit : ODBU 0% at an average price of 60.9 US cents per unit.
UHReit is the first US grocery-anchored shopping centre and self-storage Reit to list in Singapore, and back in May reported Q1 2022 distributable income of US$8.1 million, 7.9 per cent higher than Q1 2021. UHReit completed its inaugural acquisitions of Colonial Square on Nov 12, 2021 and Penrose Plaza on Nov 24, 2021, with both acquisitions contributing positively to Q1 2022 distributable income."

The forward funding investment will see FLCT fund the development of the new facility by seller Stoford Properties, a UK developer specialising in industrial, production and logistics facilities.
The maximum consideration, which is in line with an independent valuation conducted by CBRE as at Jun 1, includes the cost of development.
Located within the Hooton Business Park in Cheshire in north-west England, the property will sit on a 14.4 ha site and will have a total lettable area of 667,185 sq ft.
Development of the property is expected to be completed in the second half of 2023.
It will then be leased to Peugeot Motor Company for a lease term of 15 years with 5-yearly, upward-only rent reviews. The property will serve as Peugeot's national distribution centre in the UK.
""The forward funding acquisition presents an excellent opportunity to add a state-of-the-art logistics facility to FLCT's growing UK logistics and industrial portfolio,"" said Robert Wallace, chief executive officer of the Reit manager.

""The property will mark FLCT's fourth logistics and industrial investment in the UK and is strategically sited in a well-established logistics and industrial precinct in UK's North West, which will enable us to deepen FLCT's presence in the attractive UK logistics real estate space, while supporting our objectives of delivering sustainable long-term value to our unitholders,"" he added.

The acquisition will be FLCT's sixth property in the UK and will increase the real estate investment trust's (Reit) exposure in the UK market to 13 per cent of its total portfolio value, up from 10.7 per cent previously.

The weighting of FLCT's portfolio by value towards logistics and industrial assets will grow to 67.1 per cent, from 66.3 per cent.

Weighted average lease expiry will increase to 4.8 years from 4.6 years, with a portfolio occupancy rate of 96.2 per cent.
Including the acquisition fee payable to the Reit manager as well as professional and other fees and expenses, the total cost of the proposed acquisition is estimated to be £103.5 million.
The Reit manager said the acquisition will be funded through the proceeds of its divestment of Cross Street Exchange in Singapore and existing debt facilities.
It added that the acquisition is not expected to have any material effect on FLCT's net tangible assets.
Units of FLCT last closed flat at S$1.35 on Jun 24."
2022-07-01,SPH Reit offer closes; Cuscaden to own 61.7%,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/sph-reit-offer-closes-cuscaden-own-617,"THE chain offer for SPH Reit : SK6U +0.62% has closed with valid acceptances in respect of 402.9 million units, representing about 14.36 per cent of total issued units, according to a bourse filing on Thursday (Jun 30) night.

This will bring the Cuscaden Peak and its concert parties’ stake in the real estate investment trust (Reit) to 61.68 per cent, or about 1.73 billion units. 

The offer had previously turned unconditional on Jun 1 after it received valid acceptances representing about 4.64 per cent of total issued SPH Reit units.
Cuscaden, a consortium comprising Hotel Properties, businessman Ong Beng Seng and 2 Temasek-linked entities CLA and Mapletree, had in April 2022 offered to acquire SPH Reit at the minimum offer price of S$0.9372 per unit.
This came following the completion of an offer by Cuscaden to take SPH (Singapore Press Holdings) private, which resulted in Cuscaden and its concert parties owning 47.2 per cent of SPH Reit.
Units of SPH Reit ended Thursday at S$0.935, down S$0.005 or 0.5 per cent, before the announcement."
2022-07-05,S-Reit picks to ride on ‘structural growth trends’ in H2,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/s-reit-picks-ride-structural-growth-trends-h2,"HEADING into the second half of 2022, investors should focus on real estate investment trusts (Reits) that can deliver sustainable growth in the near to mid term.

""Risk of interest rates impacting distributions is well flagged out, but given the way we see base rates increasing, we believe that the actual impact could be a tad more than expected,"" said DBS analyst Derek Tan.

Against this tough backdrop, it is important that investors focus on Singapore Reits (S-Reits) with the potential of delivering growth in their distribution per unit and net asset value. On top of that, Tan said investors should keep an eye out for S-Reits with low refinancing risks.


Analysts who spoke to The Business Times pointed to Reits in the Singapore office, suburban retail and industrial sectors as among those that could potentially benefit from ""structural growth trends"" going into H2.

""We like the office sector, so our favourite (S-Reit pick) would be Keppel Reit,"" Tan said.

For one, the analyst sees Keppel Reit : K71U 0% as a purer play to the Singapore office sector. ""(It has a) robust outlook, coupled with minimal risk to refinancing and operational cost challenges,"" he added.
According to SGX Research, Keppel Reit was one of the top 5 S-Reits that booked the highest net institutional inflows in the first half of 2022, proportionate to their current market capitalisation.
More than three-quarters of Keppel Reit's S$9 billion portfolio as at December 2021 was located in Singapore. It also held assets in Australia and South Korea.
For FY2021 ended December, Keppel Reit reported a 31.4 per cent jump in net property income (NPI) attributable to unitholders to S$155.8 million.

Distributable income rose 9 per cent to S$212.1 million, while distribution per unit (DPU) was up 1.6 per cent to S$0.0582.

Units of Keppel Reit closed at S$1.09 on Monday (Jul 4), reflecting a yield of 5.3 per cent based on its FY2021 DPU.

Meanwhile, RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan favours Ascendas Reit : A17U 0% as his top Reit pick.

""Ascendas Reit is the largest industrial S-Reit and a good proxy to the Singapore industrial segment - which accounts for 60 per cent of its assets,"" Natarajan said. ""This, in our view, offers the best mix of defensive cum growth potential.""

In addition, Natarajan said Ascendas Reit's trading at around 5.5 per cent yield is ""attractive"", with most downside risks already buffered in.

Ascendas Reit - the first and largest locally listed industrial Reit - had S$16.3 billion in assets under management as at Dec 31, 2021. Its portfolio comprises some 220 properties across the developed markets of Singapore, Australia, the US, UK and Europe.

Ascendas Reit reported a 16.9 per cent rise in gross revenue to S$1.2 billion for FY2021, while its NPI climbed 18.6 per cent to S$920.8 million.

The Reit posted a 3.9 per cent increase in DPU to S$0.15258. Based on its closing price of S$2.87 on Jul 4, this translates to a yield of 5.3 per cent.

On the retail front, Natarajan said the potential accretive acquisition of the Mercatus suburban mall portfolio could be a key catalyst for Frasers Centrepoint Trust (FCT) : J69U +1.46%.

""We see a good possibility of FCT teaming up with its sponsor to acquire the 4 suburban retail assets from Mercatus Co-operative,"" he said in a recent report. ""(This) in our view presents a good strategic fit to FCT's portfolio and could further boost the Reit's standing as a dominant suburban mall player in Singapore.""

As at end-September 2021, FCT's portfolio comprised 9 retail malls and an office building located in the suburban regions of Singapore, with assets under management of around S$6.1 billion.

For FY2021 ended September, FCT's gross revenue more than doubled to S$341.2 million, while NPI soared 122.4 per cent to S$246.6 million.

DPU for FY2021 came in 33.7 per cent higher at S$0.12085. Units of FCT closed at S$2.26 on Jul 4, representing a yield of 5.3 per cent based on its FY2021 DPU.

Aside from FCT, DBS's Tan believes that the Mercatus sale is likely to also attract other local property players. These include fellow S-Reits CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT) : C38U 0% and Lendlease Global Commercial Reit (LREIT) : JYEU +0.98%, as well as property developers City Developments and Far East Organization.

""This transaction is expected to support capital values for retail malls in the suburban space, with selected malls in CICT, FCT, and LREIT to benefit,"" Tan said in a recent report. ""As such, we anticipate it to support valuations, implying that net asset valuations (NAVs) should remain resilient."""
2022-07-05,Silver lining for S-Reits in H2 as sector ‘bottoms out’ and rate hikes ease,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/silver-lining-s-reits-h2-sector-bottoms-out-and-rate-hikes-ease,"REAL estate investment trusts (Reits) have been pummelled by fears of rising interest rates, even as effects of the Covid-19 pandemic continue to linger.

The FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index, a global Reits benchmark, saw total returns slide to negative 18 per cent for the first half of 2022.

This comes as the US Federal Reserve wages war on inflation with a series of interest rate hikes.


Most recently, in June, the Fed raised the federal funds rate by 75 basis points to 1.5-1.75 per cent – its biggest hike since 1994 – which sent investors running for the hills.

The way DBS analyst Derek Tan describes it, the second quarter had been a period of “maximum fear”.

However, he believes investors should be looking to add at current prices and valuations as we move into the second half of the year.
“In general, we believe that the Reits sector is bottoming out given that we are now close to the end of the most aggressive rate hike momentum by the Fed,” Tan told The Business Times.

The second half of 2022, Tan opines, will see a more modest rate hike momentum that is more data-driven.

Amid the global market uncertainties, market watchers note that Singapore Reits (S-Reits) are in a better position than their global counterparts.

S-Reits have, in fact, been significantly more resilient and outperformed the global markets so far this year. Compared to the steep decline for the global Reits benchmark, the iEdge S-Reit Index in H1 generated flat total returns.

“We believe the Singapore market is slightly better positioned in terms of economic growth backed by strong government support policies, full reopening of the economy and capturing the shift in demand arising from strict Covid zero policies in North Asia,” RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan told BT.

For the second half, Reits in the office, suburban retail and industrial sectors could be potential beneficiaries from “structural growth trends,” the analysts say.

Both Tan and Natarajan point out that Reits with a Singapore office focus are likely to benefit from a lack of supply even as more firms are seen setting up their headquarters here.

In part, this is likely to be driven by “increased demand from tech and co-working firms and a shift in office demand in Hong Kong”, Natarajan said.

Meanwhile, market watchers also favour the retail Reits – particularly those with suburban properties.

While suburban malls had been resilient amid pandemic-related lockdowns and changing shopper behaviour, there are no signs yet that these malls outside of the city centre will see their strong performance taper off due to the reopening of borders and the return to office.

Tan noted that suburban retail sales appear to be “sticky” at close to 10 per cent above pre-Covid levels.

Veteran Reits investor Gabriel Yap, chairman of investment firm GCP Global, said the Singapore retail Reits are displaying “strong pricing power” after showing resilience through Covid-19.

“The pricing of the Mercatus portfolio sale could set a new higher benchmark for retail assets, especially those in locations next to MRT stations and serve a commanding suburban population,” Yap added.

BT in June reported that Mercatus Co-operative, a unit of NTUC Enterprise, is putting up a bundle of 4 of its suburban retail properties in Singapore for sale with an expected price tag “in excess of S$4 billion”.

The 4 retail malls are Jurong Point, AMK Hub, Mercatus’ half-stake in Nex, and some 110,000 sq ft of strata space in Thomson Plaza, which is branded as “Swing By @ Thomson Plaza”.

At the same time, the analysts believe the industrial Reits could offer the best defensive plays under the uncertain current market conditions.

“Data-points such as manufacturing growth and the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) still point to expansionary demand in the Singapore industrial sector,” Natarajan said.

For now, however, all eyes are on whether the central banks are able to dodge a potential recessionary scenario.

“The key challenge that investors must watch out for is the persistent inflationary pressures and whether central banks are able to tackle inflation by raising interest rates without inflicting too much damage to economic growth,” Natarajan added. “If central banks are able to achieve a soft landing by controlling inflation without severely damaging growth, we see more upside potential for Reits.”"
2022-07-10,SPH Reit kicks off reporting calendar with marked recovery in tenant sales,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/sph-reit-kicks-reporting-calendar-marked-recovery-tenant-sales,"THIRTEEN Singapore real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) have announced dates of their upcoming earnings releases or business updates, with SPH Reit : SK6U +0.62% kicking off the current reporting season for the sector with the release of its third-quarter FY2022 business update (ended May 31, 2022) on Jul 7, 2022.

Of the 13, 9 will be reporting first-half financial results for the year, while 3 will be releasing business updates for their respective periods ending Jun 30, 2022.

The rest of the sector will be unveiling dates of their earnings or business updates over the coming weeks.


SPH Reit in its latest Q3 FY2022 business updates announced a distribution per unit (DPU) of 1.45 Singapore cents, which represents a 5.1 per cent year-on-year increase and brings the annualised distribution yield to 5.81 per cent.

Ascribing to high vaccination rates and the ease of safe distancing measures in both Singapore and Australia, SPH Reit highlighted overall improvement in financial performance, with year-to-date Q3 FY2022 gross revenue recording a 0.9 per cent year-on-year increase to S$211.6 million.

Sales for the same period increased by 12 per cent and 2 per cent in Singapore and Australia respectively.
Across SPH Reit's portfolio, occupancy rate maintained at 97.6 per cent, while weighted average lease expiry (WALE) stood at 5.4 years by net lettable area and 2.9 years by gross rental income.

In Singapore, its Paragon property saw marked recovery following the relaxation of restrictions in March/April 2022 as tenant sales for the quarter grew 45 per cent year-on-year and exceeded pre-Covid levels.

The Clementi Mall recorded a 6.3 per cent improvement in tenant sales supported by strong food and beverage (F&B) performance.

Its Australia properties also observed recovery in tenant sales post the spike in cases earlier this year.

The iEdge S-Reit Index, a benchmark for Singapore Reits, maintained resiliency for H1 2022 with flat total returns, compared to the FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index (a benchmark for global Reits) which declined 18 per cent. SGX RESEARCH"
2022-07-13,"Retail, office spaces set to recover but residential demand will slide: Moody’s",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/property/retail-office-spaces-set-recover-residential-demand-will-slide-moodys,"THE significant easing of Covid restrictions in Singapore means commercial property owners will stand to benefit from a boost in earnings on the back of strong pent-up demand, according to Moody's Investors Service.

The credit rating company also believes improving demand and limited new supply of quality office space in Singapore's CBD (central business district) will continue to lend office asset owners more bargaining power over rents.

In a report on Wednesday (Jul 13), Moody's highlighted real estate investment trusts (Reits) CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U 0% (CICT), Frasers Centrepoint Trust : J69U +1.46% (FCT) and Mapletree Commercial Trust : N2IU +0.74% (MCT) as key beneficiaries from the recovery in both retail and office demand.
The company expects earnings of CICT and MCT to increase substantially following recent merger and acquisition activities, while FCT's earnings are expected to remain stable in FY2022 to FY2023.

All 3 Reits are projected to see an aggregate Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) increase of 22 per cent this year, and a further 14 per cent in 2023.

""Rated Reits' aggregate leverage - as measured by net debt/Ebitda - will rise temporarily this year, but interest coverage and debt/deposited assets will continue to be strong,"" said Moody's research team.
""Higher retail sales and footfall following the easing of coronavirus measures will reduce both the need for rent rebates and the likelihood of rent deferrals, which will support earnings recovery for retail property owners.""

It also sees a strong recovery in earnings growth for large property developers City Developments : C09 -0.3%, GuocoLand : F17 0% and UOL Group : U14 0%, as their investment property and hospitality operations make up 35 to 70 per cent of total assets combined.

Moody's projects the 3 developers' aggregate Ebitda to rise by 18 per cent in 2022 and a further 22 per cent in 2023, primarily due to an expected earnings recovery at their investment properties and hotel operations.

Singapore's residential property space, however, is anticipated to experience weaker contracted sales over 2022 and 2023. The research team said this is given lower sales volume and the likelihood of subdued launches following a low volume of land transactions in recent years.

Demand for private residential properties will also be dampened by rising mortgage rates, cooling measures and tax hikes, added Moody's.

""Given the more bearish market environment and weaker supply pipeline, we expect contracted sales of large developers will decline in 2022 from their strong performance in 2021. Contracted sales of developers could increase in 2023 if they replenish their land bank by participating in government land sales tenders, or complete en-bloc transactions in 2022,"" said its research team.

2022-07-14,"Pressure is on new Mapletree Reit to shine, given financial hit for its sponsor in the merger",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/pressure-new-mapletree-reit-shine-given-financial-hit-its-sponsor-merger,"BACKED by its strength in managing listed real-estate investment trusts (Reits) and private real-estate equity funds, Temasek's privately held Mapletree Investments has consistently achieved return on equity (ROE) in excess of 10 per cent - outperforming many listed property groups.
Mapletree posted net profit of S$1.96 billion for the financial year ended Mar 31, 2022, up 6.2 per cent year on year. The group delivered a record year of recurring earnings at S$810.2 million, up 27.9 per cent from the previous financial year.

But Mapletree appears to have hit trouble with the merging of Mapletree Commercial Trust : N2IU +0.74% (MCT) and Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust (MNACT) via a scheme of arrangement.
While the proposed merger received approval from unitholders of MCT and MNACT, Mapletree looks to be taking a big hit financially, as MCT's unit price has fallen since the announcement of the proposed merger on Dec 31, 2021.

Mapletree's pain

At the time of the announcement of the proposed merger, Mapletree held stakes of 32.6 per cent in MCT and 38.1 per cent in MNACT.

MCT's unit price has fallen 8.5 per cent since the merger announcement: from S$2 as at Dec 27, 2021, to S$1.83 as at Jul 13 (Wednesday). This means a lower value of Mapletree's stake in MCT.

Over the same period, the unit price of large-cap commercial Reit CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U 0%(CICT) rose 6.5 per cent.

The proposed merger has MCT buying all the units of MNACT for a consideration of either all scrip (being new MCT units), a mix of scrip and cash, or all cash.

Under the all-cash option, MNACT's unitholders will receive S$1.1949 per MNACT unit held. This is superior to MNACT's unit price of S$1.11 pre-announcement.

Mapletree will take the scrip-only consideration of 0.5963 new MCT unit per MNACT unit held. Based on MCT's unit price on Jul 13, this translates into a value of just over S$1.09 per MNACT unit held. Thus, Mapletree sees value erosion on its MNACT stake relative to the value pre-announcement.

MCT is making a preferential offering - open for application between Jul 12, 2022 and Jul, 20, 2022 - of nearly 1.02 billion units at S$2.0039 per unit to raise S$2.04 billion for the cash component of the scheme consideration. Mapletree is undertaking to subscribe for up to the entire preferential offering.

Based on where MCT is trading, possibly hardly any unitholders, besides Mapletree, will subscribe for the issue. Based on MCT's unit price of as at Jul 13, 2022, Mapletree may lose as much as S$177 million from taking up new MCT units under the offering.

Overall, Mapletree may be taking a hit of over S$380 million from the creation of the merged entity - to be named Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust (MPACT).

Perhaps the legacy of MPACT's birth is to sound the death knell on Reit mergers.

The equities market could be giving a thumbs down to Reits consolidating, despite arguments that greater scale brings benefits, such as more following by institutional investors, higher debt capacity, better portfolio diversification and more competitive funding.

Whether Mapletree's support in the birthing of MPACT pays off, and how investors take to future mergers among Reits, will hinge on how MPACT performs operationally and in the stock market.

Room for optimism

Despite its difficult birth, MPACT may flourish. Its portfolio will include best-in-class Singapore assets such as Mapletree Business City and VivoCity, which should benefit from the flight to quality in the Singapore commercial property space. These assets sit in the heart of the Greater Southern Waterfront, which will transform into a new major gateway and location for urban living along Singapore's southern coast.

The outbreak of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 in January led to the authorities in Hong Kong imposing unprecedented restrictions on social activities to slow the spread of the virus. But these restrictions have since been relaxed. Prospects are therefore better for the retail-centric Festival Walk in Hong Kong's Kowloon Tong, which will be a key asset in MPACT's portfolio.

MPACT will have over S$17 billion of assets under management and is set to be among Asia's 10 largest Reits by market capitalisation. The trust will have exposure to 5 Asian gateway markets, namely Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Japan and Korea.

MPACT's focus on Asia arguably makes more sense than the geographic mix of bigger pre-dominantly commercial Reits such as CICT and Hong Kong-listed Link Reit. CICT's property portfolio is spread across Singapore, Germany and Australia, while Link owns assets in Hong Kong, China, Australia and the United Kingdom.

Focusing on major Asian cities can bring greater operational synergies for MPACT. Perhaps there are synergies from serving retail tenants in Singapore and Hong Kong, and sharing best practices between the 2 markets.

Also, investors who seek a commercial property proxy in Asia may be drawn to MPACT.

The merged entity will pay its manager using a formula that pegs the management fee to distributable income and distribution per unit (DPU) growth. Investors will likely be happy that the manager's interest is directly linked with growing DPU, as long as the manager pursues such growth without taking on excessive risks.

The stakes are high. MPACT's manager needs to work the assets hard and passionately push its investment story so that its unitholders, including Mapletree, can prosper. Do a great job, and more Reit mergers may follow.

The door may not be shut on a potential merger of Mapletree Industrial Trust and Mapletree Logistics Trust. "
2022-07-26,"S-Reits’ results to test reopening, recovery narrative as risks loom",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/s-reits-results-test-reopening-recovery-narrative-risks-loom,"MOST of the Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) are scheduled to announce their latest quarterly results for the period ended Jun 30 over the next couple of weeks.

The S-Reits' performance over the first half of the year - particularly in the latest quarter to June - will test the strength of the sector's recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.

For now, the market narrative could not be more positive: The reopening of borders and global economies bode well for real estate investment trusts (Reits), especially those in the hospitality sector. And indeed, the ""smart money"" appears to be flowing in.
""The reopening theme had a significant impact on the S-Reit market, with 4 of the 5 stapled hospitality trusts ranking among the 10 (Reits and property trusts) that attracted the highest net institutional inflows in H1 2022,"" said Singapore Exchange (SGX) market strategist Geoff Howie.
Ascott Residence Trust led the way for the hospitality Reits, attracting some S$41.5 million of net institutional inflows in the first half. This was followed by S$16.1 million in net institutional inflows for Frasers Hospitality Trust, S$6.7 million for CDL Hospitality Trusts and S$1.3 million for Ara US Hospitality Trust.

Howie noted that the 5 Singapore-listed hospitality trusts in total garnered S$62 million of net institutional inflows in H1, and averaged total returns of 17 per cent.
""Frasers Hospitality Trust, Ascott Residence Trust, Far East Hospitality Trust and CDL Hospitality Trusts (also) ranked among the 10 strongest performing Asia-Pacific-listed Reits in H1 2022,"" he added.

S-Reits in other sub-sectors were no slouches either, with those that have already released their results for the latest quarter giving some inkling of what is to come.

Commercial Reit Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust (MNACT) logged the highest net institutional inflows among the S-Reits for the first half at S$185.8 million.

The Reit, which released its latest quarterly business update on Jul 21, reported a 4.1 per cent year on year growth in net property income (NPI) for the first quarter ended June.

This was largely attributable to full-quarter contribution from Hewlett-Packard Japan Headquarters Building, which it acquired in June last year, as well as a lower quantum of rental relief granted for Hong Kong shopping mall Festival Walk.

However, tighter social-distancing measures and bans on dining-in imposed by the authorities to contain the spread of Covid-19 at the start of the year cut Festival Walk's shopper traffic by 10 per cent in Q1 while tenant sales dipped 1.1 per cent.
In the industrial space, Sabana Industrial Reit (Sabana Reit) on Jul 20 posted a 7.4 per cent increase in distribution per unit (DPU) to S$0.0159 for the first half ended June.

Rental reversion for H1 came in at 9.1 per cent, with portfolio occupancy rising 4.8 percentage points to 88.2 per cent.

Sabana Reit was also among the S-Reits with the highest net institutional inflows in H1, drawing in S$9.2 million.

SGX's Howie noted that aside from the reopening plays, restructuring themes have benefitted S-Reits such as MNACT and Sabana Reit.

MNACT, he said, has seen a ""surge"" in trading turnover this year following the announcement of the planned merger with Mapletree Commercial Trust (MCT), while Sabana Reit is entering into the next stage of its rejuvenation plans and targeting to upsize its portfolio to more than S$1 billion in the next 3 to 5 years.

""(S-Reits) have continued to attract more than their fair share of investor activity, with the sector representing more than 10 per cent of the total market capitalisation of the Singapore stock market, and more than 20 per cent of its day-to-day turnover,"" Howie said.

Apart from MNACT and Sabana Reit, other S-Reits that have reported their results so far have painted a glowing picture.

SPH Reit on Jul 7 posted a 5.1 per cent increase in DPU to S$0.0145 for the Q3 ended May on the back of a marked recovery in tenant sales.

Mapletree Logistics Trust (MLT) on Jul 21 reported DPU of S$0.02268 for the first quarter ended June, up 5 per cent from a year ago. The industrial Reit's Q1 gross revenue and NPI jumped 14.6 per cent and 13.2 per cent, respectively.

As more S-Reits report their financial results in the weeks ahead, it is easy to be lulled into a false sense of security.

The headline figures are likely to show that the reopening recovery is well and truly on the way.

But with inflation and interest rate hikes looming over the global economy, investors will do well to temper their optimism.

Assuming utility rates could potentially double, RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan said S-Reits could see DPU declines of between 1 per cent and 5 per cent this year, depending on their utilities hedge position.

""With the sharp spike in interest rates, investors have been paying close attention to S-Reits' debt profiles to assess the potential impact,"" he added."
2022-07-26,Aims Apac Reit Q1 DPU up 1.3% to S$0.0228,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/aims-apac-reit-q1-dpu-13-s00228,"AIMS Apac Real Estate Investment Trust's (AA Reit) distribution per unit (DPU) rose by 1.3 per cent to S$0.0228 in the first quarter of FY2023, from S$0.0225 in the year-ago period.

Gross revenue was up 29.8 per cent to S$41.3 million in Q1, from S$31.8 million a year ago, while net property income (NPI) grew 34.3 per cent to S$31 million, from S$23.1 million last year.

This was due to contributions from Australian supermarket and grocery chain, Woolworths Headquarters, which was completed on Nov 15, 2021, as well as higher rental income from existing properties, the industrial Reit's manager said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday (Jul 26).
The higher revenue was however offset by higher operating expenses, distributions to perpetual securities holders, higher interest expense and management fees following the acquisition of Woolworths Headquarters, AA Reit added.

Meanwhile, distributable income gained 2.7 per cent year on year to S$16.3 million, from S$15.9 million.

The distribution is scheduled to be paid out on Sep 23, after books closure on Aug 4.
As at Jun 30, the Reit has an overall portfolio occupancy of 97.9 per cent, while weighted average lease expiry (WALE) stood at 4.93 years.

It expects the healthy committed occupancy to sustain as demand for industrial space continues to be underpinned by the ""resilient e-commerce and logistics sectors"" as well as the reopening of Singapore's borders.
AA Reit's portfolio is made up of 29 properties - 26 in Singapore and 3 in Australia. They include logistics and warehouses, general industrials, light industrials, business parks as well as 1 high-tech space.

Recently, the Reit tried to acquire the Sime Darby Business Centre along 315 Alexandra Road for S$106.6 million, but was unsuccessful.

The Reit's units closed 0.7 per cent or S$0.01 higher at S$1.39 on Monday."
2022-07-26,"More information from Reit managers could comfort investors as inflation, interest rates surge",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/more-information-reit-managers-could-comfort-investors-inflation-interest,"SURGING inflation and interest rate hikes are likely to be at the top of the minds of investors in Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits), as earnings season rolls in.

After all, the European Central Bank (ECB) late last week hiked interest rates for the first time in over a decade, while the US Federal Reserve is expected to increase rates again later this week.

A Reuters poll of economists pointed to the likelihood of a 75 basis point (bps) hike by the US Fed.
Amid the reopening of borders and economies, the real estate investment trusts (Reits) are widely expected to put up a good showing for the period ended June.

But the Reit managers should offer more information to allay investor concerns about rising debt and operational costs.

For example, the manager of Sabana Industrial Reit (Sabana Reit), which was among the first S-Reits to release its results, guided that every potential 20 bps increase in interest rates could result in a 0.5 per cent reduction in distribution per unit (DPU) per annum, or a decline of S$0.0001.
Sabana Reit posted DPU up 7.4 per cent to S$0.0159 for the first half ended June.

The Reit manager added that 75.3 per cent of its borrowings are on fixed rates, with an average term of 2.4 years.

Meanwhile, Mapletree Logistics Trust (MLT), which reported a 5 per cent increase in DPU to S$0.02268 for the first quarter ended June, noted that every potential 25 bps increase in base rates may result in a S$0.0001 reduction in its DPU per quarter.

Some 80 per cent of MLT's total debt has been hedged into fixed rates, while about 73 per cent of its income stream for the next 12 months has been hedged into Singapore dollar (SGD), the Reit manager said.

However, Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust (MNACT), in its Q1 update on Jul 21, did not mention the effect of potential rising interest rates on the Reit.

The Reit manager said some 79 per cent of its debt are in fixed rate borrowings, with about 74 per cent of expected distributable income for the current financial year hedged into SGD.

Understandably, this could be due to the fact that MNACT is currently in the final stages of its merger with Mapletree Commercial Trust (MCT).

Aside from the impact of interest rates to DPU, Reit managers should also put out information about how rising utility rates - as well as manpower costs - could impact DPU to investors.

For example, Donald Han, the chief executive officer of the manager of Sabana Reit, shared at a briefing accompanying its results announcement that while most increases to utility costs are passed on to tenants, some 15 per cent of the Reit's gross floor area (GFA) are common areas, with the utility costs borne by the Reit.

For some Reits in other sectors such as retail, he added, these common areas could go up to 30-40 per cent of GFA.

Han said the Reit manager was mindful of the rising costs, including for manpower such as security guards, cleaners, and gardeners or landscapers.

""While we believe S-Reits have largely priced in the impending rate hikes - assuming no 100 bps hike - we see more downside for the sector if economic growth starts weaning off sharply,"" warned RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan.

""Despite rising macroeconomic risks and inflationary pressures, we expect S-Reits to register positive DPU growth in 2022,"" he added."
2022-07-25,"Keppel DC Reit posts 2.5% growth in H1 DPU amid rising energy costs, currency fluctuations",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/keppel-dc-reit-posts-25-growth-h1-dpu-amid-rising-energy-costs,"DATA centre-focused Keppel Data Centre (DC) real estate investment trust : AJBU -0.49% (Reit) reported 2.5 per cent growth in its H1 2022 distribution per unit (DPU) to S$0.05049 from S$0.04924 a year prior.

Distributable income rose 8.2 per cent to S$91.2 million, mainly due to contributions from the 3 accretive acquisitions - Guangdong Data Centre, London Data Centre and Eindhoven Campus - as well as investment in the NetCo bonds, asset enhancement initiatives at DC1 and the Dublin assets, and the completion of Intellicentre 3 East Data Centre.

The Reit manager said contract renewals and client expansion also contributed to the growth.
Gross revenue edged up 0.3 per cent to S$135.5 million in the first half, driven by contributions from Guangdong DC and Eindhoven DC, as well as the acquisition of London DC, among others.
The higher revenue was partially offset by the divestment of iseek DC and lower contributions from Singapore colocation assets largely due to provisions made for DXC at KDC SGP 1 and higher electricity costs.

Net property income (NPI) dipped 0.5 per cent to S$123.2 million in H1, from S$123.8 million in the corresponding period a year ago.
In response to questions from analysts and media at a briefing accompanying the result announcement, the Reit manager said there was ""insignificant impact"" on DPU quarter on quarter arising from electricity price fluctuations.

Anthea Lee, chief executive officer of the Keppel DC Reit manager, explained that ""significantly above 90 per cent"" of energy costs for its colocation data centres are passed through to clients. She added that clients from the Reit's shell and core and fully fitted data centres contract electricity directly from the power suppliers.

To manage energy costs, Lee said, the Reit also tries to consume less electricity by being more energy efficient, pass on more of the electricity costs to customers when possible, and lock in lower electricity prices with suppliers at the right opportunity.

In addition, Keppel DC Reit's first half revenue was also affected by the depreciation of the euro, pound and Australian dollar against the Singapore dollar.

Adam Lee, chief financial officer of the Reit manager, said a ""substantial amount"" - ""significantly above 90 per cent"" of the Reit's income based in these currencies has been hedged. (*see amendment note)

""The impact arising from the depreciation of such foreign currencies against the Singapore dollar has been significantly reduced (due to) hedging strategies in place,"" Low said.

To mitigate the Reit's exposure to interest rate fluctuations, the manager said it has hedged 76 per cent of its borrowings as at end June through floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps.

Keppel DC Reit's average cost of debt stood at 1.9 per cent per annum as at Jun 30, with an interest coverage ratio of 9.2 times. Aggregate leverage stood at 35.3 per cent.

Portfolio occupancy for the REIT stands at 98.2 per cent with portfolio weighted average lease expiry at 7.6 years.

With digitalisation's continued acceleration, technology adoption will bolster demand for data centres, with the rise of 5G and artificial intelligence, according to Keppel DC Reit's manager. The manager will be focusing on its value creation strategy, and capitalising on growth opportunities through organic growth of its DC portfolio, as well as through accretive acquisitions.

Units of Keppel DC REIT closed up 1 per cent or S$0.02 to S$2.01 on Jul 25."
2022-07-26,Brokers' take: CGS-CIMB raises ESR-Logos Reit target on post-merger benefits,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/brokers-take-cgs-cimb-raises-esr-logos-reit-target-post-merger-benefits,"CGS-CIMB has raised its target price on ESR-Logos Reit : J91U +1.85% to S$0.51 from S$0.474 and reiterated its ""add"" call on the industrial real estate investment trust (Reit).

The research team ranks the Reit as ""one of the most attractively valued"" industrial S-Reits in its coverage with a FY2022 distribution per unit (DPU) yield of 7.3 per cent, versus a peer average of around 6 per cent, according to a report dated Jul 25.
Furthermore, CGS-CIMB believes the market has not recognised the benefits of the merger of ESR-Reit and Ara Logos Logistics Trust to form ESR-Logos Reit.
This includes a 60 per cent expansion in market capitalisation to S$2.7 billion as at July 2022, higher trading liquidity and more index representation. The merger also allowed for future-proofing of the Reit's portfolio via greater geographic and sub-sector diversity, according to CGS-CIMB analyst Lock Mun Yee.

Her new target price of S$0.51 represents a potential upside of 22.9 per cent from the counter's last trading price of S$0.415 as at 10.52 am on Tuesday. The counter was trading 1.2 per cent or S$0.005 higher at the time.

Post-merger, a ""sizeable"" 52.3 per cent of ESR-Logos Reit's expanded portfolio income was from the logistics or warehouse sector in Singapore and Australia, which is seen as more resilient, the research team said.
Extending the average underlying land tenor of the Reit's portfolio has also increased net asset value robustness. That being said, the Singapore market remains a ""significant 71 per cent"" of assets under management, limiting foreign exchange volatility.

Noting potential upside from inorganic growth drivers, the research team believes ESR-Logos Reit has ample opportunities for acquisition growth, with potential debt headroom of S$941.9 million based on a post-merger gearing of 40.8 per cent."
2022-07-26,Keppel Reit H1 DPU up 1% on Keppel Bay Tower contribution,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/keppel-reit-h1-dpu-1-keppel-bay-tower-contribution,"Keppel Reit : K71U 0% reported a 1 per cent year-on-year increase in H1 2022 distribution per unit (DPU) to S$0.0297 from S$0.0294 previously.

The Reit manager announced a 4.6 per cent growth in H1 distribution to unitholders to S$110.5 million from S$105.7 million in a regulatory filing after market close on Tuesday (Jul 26).

Property income and net property income rose in tandem with distribution to unitholders and DPU. Property income in the period rose 3.7 per cent to S$109.8 million from S$105.8 million a year ago, while net property income was up 6 per cent to S$89.5 million, from S$84.4 million previously.

The increase was mainly driven by the contribution from Keppel Bay Tower and higher net property income from Ocean Financial Centre, 8 Exhibition Street and Pinnacle Office park. This was partially offset by the lack of contribution from 275 George Street post-divestment and lower net property income from Victoria Police Centre and T Tower due to weaker foreign currency exchange rates.

Keppel Reit's committed occupancy rate stands at 95.5 per cent with the portfolio top 10 weighted average lease expiry standing at 6 years. Tenant retention rate was 89 per cent for H1 2022.

About 881,900 square feet of space was committed in H1, with the majority of the leases concluded in Singapore. The weighted average signing rent for Ocean Financial Centre, Marina Bay Financial Centre and One Raffles Quay was approximately S$11.43 psf per month for the first half.
The Reit manager said it would focus on maintaining stable and sustainable distribution while achieving long-term growth.
At a briefing accompanying the result announcement, Rodney Yeo, the Reit manager's head of asset management, shared that the office market is on a tear lately in the CBD as supply is tight, causing rents to move up ""very quickly"" in May and June.
Therefore, the Reit witnessed positive rental reversions of 8.7 per cent across its entire portfolio in the first half of 2022, with the second quarter's reversions coming in at 7.5 per cent, he pointed out.
""If we blend the leases in documentation together with the second quarter, those that actually signed in the second quarter, we are possibly in the double-digit range for reversions,"" he added.
As at June 30, occupancy at Ocean Financial Centre, One Raffles Quay and Keppel Bay Tower has fallen to 92.8 per cent, 93.8 per cent and 95.3 per cent respectively, from 94.6 per cent, 98.5 per cent and 96.4 per cent as at end 2021.

Asked what caused the decline, Yeo said it was ""just timing"", reiterating that a number of leases are in documentation at the moment. If those leases were taken into consideration, occupancies will probably stand in the 97-98 per cent range.

Positive rental reversions for its Singapore CBD portfolio is at about 11 per cent, he revealed.

As Keppel Reit only has a one-third stake in Marina Bay Financial Centre and One Raffles Quay, a question was posed to the Reit manager if it would be interested to take up additional one-third stakes in these properties.

Shirley Ng, its deputy chief executive officer and head of investments, divulged that it ""definitely will be keen"" to look at acquiring larger stakes as they are prime assets in the Reit's portfolio. ""We are very happy with our one-third stake,"" she said.

Units of Keppel Reit closed 1.9 per cent or S$0.02 higher at S$1.10 on Tuesday."
2022-07-27,ESR-Logos Reit eyes up to S$450m divestments to rejuvenate portfolio; H1 DPU down 6%,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/esr-logos-reit-eyes-s450m-divestments-rejuvenate-portfolio-h1-dpu-down-6,"THE manager of ESR-Logos Reit : J91U +1.85% on Wednesday (Jul 27) said it has identified up to S$450 million of non-core assets - over 8 per cent of its S$5.5 billion portfolio - for divestment over the next 12-24 months, in an effort to recalibrate its portfolio and unlock value.

""These non-core assets are really small, non-scalable, and have shorter land leases,"" Adrian Chui, chief executive officer of the manager of ESR-Logos Reit, said at a briefing accompanying its first half 2022 results announcement.

Proceeds from the divestments may be used to pare down debt or be redeployed towards the acquisition of higher quality new economy assets, the real estate investment trust (Reit) manager said.
The Reit manager added that it has divested 7 properties since the start of 2021, with an average premium of 7.5 per cent over the assets' fair value.

""As we said during the merger, we have an initial pipeline of very low hanging pipeline assets from our sponsor - in Australia, in Singapore and in Japan - of up to US$2 billion,"" Chui said.

""These are really good quality new economy assets that we can look to acquire and improve our overall quality portfolio,"" he added. ""These assets are actually freehold or have very long leases… which will further drive net asset value (NAV).""
In its first set of financial results released after the completion of the merger of ESR-Reit and Ara Logos Logistics Trust (ALog Trust) in April 2022, ESR-Logos Reit posted a distribution per unit (DPU) of S$0.0146 for H1 ended June, 6 per cent lower than the S$0.01554 recorded in the year-ago period.

This was mainly due to higher utility expenses and the full impact of an enlarged unit base from the equity fundraising completed in May and August 2021. A portion of the funds raised was deployed towards asset enhancement initiatives (AEI) that are still ongoing.

Chui noted that the higher utility costs accounted for up to 80 per cent of the H1 DPU decline.

Starting July, the Reit manager said more than 90 per cent of utilities costs will be on a pass-through cost recovery basis. In addition, it is increasing its service charges to mitigate rising inflationary pressures.

Chui also pointed out that a quarter-on-quarter comparison of DPU would give a fairer picture of the Reit's performance post-merger. ""Comparing year on year, it's a little bit like apples and oranges,"" he said.

For the second quarter ended Jun 30, ESR-Logs Reit posted a 1.9 per cent rise in DPU to S$0.00737, from S$0.00723 in the first quarter.

On the net property income (NPI) and gross revenue front, the Reit saw gains in H1 due to contributions from the merger between ESR-Reit and ALog Trust. However, NPI rose at a slower pace as the surge in global energy prices and higher electricity demand led to higher utility expenses, which increased property expenses in H1. 

NPI for the period rose 18.2 per cent year on year to S$102.8 million from S$87 million, while gross revenue increased 23.3 per cent on the year to S$147.7 million from S$119.8 million.

The amount available for distribution to unitholders stood at S$73.6 million, 29.6 per cent higher than the S$56.8 million recorded in the previous year. This was mainly due to higher NPI and income contributions from 2 property funds held via ALog Trust.

NPI jumped 60.3 per cent to S$63.3 million, while gross revenue rose 47.8 per cent to S$88.1 million in the same period. The amount available for distribution to unitholders for Q2 was 51.2 per cent higher quarter on quarter at S$44.3 million.
A cumulative distribution of S$0.0091 per unit for the period between Jan 1 and Apr 21 was paid on Jun 23. The manager said that the remaining S$0.0055 per unit will be paid on Sep 27, after the record date on Aug 4. It added that ESR-Logos Reit will pay its distributions on a half-yearly basis instead of a quarterly basis with effect from the second half of 2022.
Portfolio occupancy rose to 94.1 per cent in Q2, with the Singapore and Australia portfolio occupancy being 92.6 per cent and 99.4 per cent respectively.

In H1 2022, 196,035 square metres (sq m) of space was leased, 52,776 sq m being from new leases and the rest from lease renewals. Tenants secured during the period include NTS Components Singapore, with existing tenants including EGIS Nanotech and Rhenus Warehousing Solutions renewing their leases.

""Leasing activities remained active with new demand from logistics, manufacturing and electronics sectors,"" the manager noted.

The Reit's weighted average lease expiry as at Jun 30 stood at 3 years. Rental income contributions from the Reit's top 10 tenants accounted for 27.3 per cent of the entire portfolio, with no single tenant contributing more than 4.7 per cent.

Separately, ESR-Logos Reit's manager announced on Wednesday that a S$32 million AEI will commence at the Reit's 16 Tai Seng Street property in August 2022. The manager added that the estimated yield on cost is up to 6 per cent.

The AEI will help create an additional 2,793 sq m of space at the property to bring the total gross floor area to around 22,800 sq m. Post AEI, the plot ratio will increase to 3.5 from 3.08.

Ahead of the AEI's completion, the manager has bagged an anchor tenant who will occupy 2,274 sq m of space at 16 Tai Seng Street, equivalent to about 12 per cent of the property's total net leasable area. The space will be used as the tenant's regional headquarters.

ESR Group has acquired 654,546 shares in ESR-LOGOS Funds Management, the manager of ESR-Logos Reit, from Tong Jinquan, bringing its stake in the manager to over 90 per cent.

The company is also in the process of acquiring an additional 189.9 million ESR-LOGOS units from Tong, and will be the largest unitholder of E-Logos Reit with 14.4 per cent. Before ESR's acquisition, Tong was the largest unitholder of E-Logos; he has been a shareholder of E-Logos' manager since October 2018.

ESR-Logos Reit ended flat at S$0.42 on Wednesday."
2022-07-27,Suntec Reit’s H1 DPU up 15.8% on higher income,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/suntec-reits-h1-dpu-158-higher-income,"SUNTEC real estate investment trust's (Reit) distribution per unit (DPU) grew 15.8 per cent year on year to S$0.0481 for its 6-month period ended Mar 31, 2022, from S$0.04154 last year.

Gross revenue rose 22.1 per cent to S$203.5 million for the first half of this year, from S$166.8 million in the corresponding year-ago period.

The Reit's manager on Wednesday (Jul 27) attributed the higher revenue mainly to contribution from The Minster Building - newly acquired in July 2021, higher revenue from Suntec City, Suntec Singapore, 21 Harris Street and Olderfleet, 477 Collins Street.
The commercial Reit's net property income (NPI) also gained 35.8 per cent to S$152.9 million in H1 this year, from S$112.6 million in the year-ago period.

Further, distributable income grew 16.9 per cent to S$138.1 million in H1 2022, from S$118.2 million last year.

The manager of Suntec Reit noted in particular that its topline had been slightly dampened by a lower gross revenue from its Australian property on 177 Pacific Highway due to lower occupancy and a weaker Australian dollar.
""The CBD retail market in Melbourne continues to be weak as tourism restrictions and flexible remote work arrangements have led to declines in shopper traffic and retail sales,"" said the manager. ""Retail rents in the CBD are expected to remain weak despite further easing of restrictions as the return to office is slow.""

Separately, while its Singapore offices and retail have enjoyed good growth in H1, the Reit's manager warned of a slower recovery at Suntec Convention. They expect income from Suntec Convention to remain impacted for the whole of 2022. 

A distribution of S$0.02419 per unit for the period Apr 1 to Jun 30 will be paid on Aug 29 after book closure on Aug 4.

Suntec Reit closed 0.6 per cent or S$0.01 higher at S$1.59 on Tuesday.

2022-07-28,Digital Core Reit reports lower-than-expected H1 DPU of 2.06 US cents,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/digital-core-reit-reports-lower-expected-h1-dpu-206-us-cents,"THE manager of Digital Core Reit (DC Reit) on Thursday (Jul 28) reported a distribution per unit (DPU) of US$0.0206 for the first half of 2022, a performance that slightly missed the mark.

The pure-play data centre real estate investment trust (Reit) made its trading debut on the Singapore Exchange on Dec 6, 2021, and at the time, it had forecasted a DPU of US$0.0209 for the half year ended Jun 30, according to its interim financial statements.

Together with a DPU of US$0.0031 for the stub period Dec 6-31, 2021, a total DPU of US$0.0237 will be paid to unitholders on Sep 28, the manager said.
Gross revenue was 0.3 per cent lower than expected at US$52.8 million, but net property income turned out to be 5.9 per cent higher than projected at US$35.4 million, due to lower-than-expected property expenses.

The manager noted that despite higher-than-expected net property income, profit attributable to non-controlling interests came in lower than expected, whereas profit attributable to unitholders was higher than the forecast level.

After adjusting for distribution adjustments, distributable income came in 2.2 per cent lower than the forecast figure at US$23.2 million.
Although global growth is expected to slow, the manager said increased investments in digital infrastructure and the adoption of new technologies bode well for the digital economy and the growth of data centres.

It added that DC Reit is well-positioned to benefit from positive industry trends, given its operational expertise and industry network.

DC Reit owns a diversified portfolio of 10 income-producing facilities in core data centre markets across the United States and Canada, and these are 100 per cent leased as at Jun 30, with a weighted average lease expiration of about 5.2 years, the manager said.

In April, DC Reit entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of its floating rate exposure, resulting in half its total interest rate exposure now hedged.

DC Reit units closed flat at US$0.825 on Thursday.

Distributable income rose 3.4 per cent to S$347.3 million for the period, from S$335.9 million a year ago, amid an income boost from Singapore's reopening and the trust's portfolio reconstitution efforts.

Net property income for the period was up 6.2 per cent to S$501.6 million, driven by CICT's acquisition of a 70 per cent interest in the CapitaSky development and 3 Australian assets, as well as higher rental income. This was partly dampened by its divestment of the JCube mall, as well as a 7.2 per cent rise in property operating expenses to S$186 million.
The trust's aggregate leverage was higher at 40.6 per cent as of end-June, compared to 37.2 per cent as of end-2021, due to the acquisitions. Its interest cover remained unchanged at 4.1 times. Some 81 per cent of its total borrowings were on fixed rates, with an average term to maturity of 4.4 years.
The average cost of debt is 2.4 per cent per annum.
Meanwhile, committed portfolio occupancy stood at 93.8 per cent as of end-June, with about 1.7 million square feet (sq ft) of new leases and renewals in H1. This comprises 600,000 sq ft of retail space and 1.1 million sq ft of office space. Notable tenants include Lululemon at Raffles City Singapore and Rakuten Asia at CapitaGreen.
""We continue to see CICT's portfolio recovery, in line with the reopening of Singapore's borders and easing of Covid-19 community measures. Riding on the positive momentum, CICT's operating metrics, including tenant sales, shopper traffic, atrium space take-up and return of office community have recorded improvements,"" said Tony Tan, chief executive of the trust manager.

Tan anticipates higher occupancy levels for the hotels at Raffles City Singapore and the serviced residence at CapitaSpring. CapitaSky and the Australian assets are also expected to lift third-quarter portfolio performance. Over in Australia, there is a ""flight to quality"", which resulted in increases in face rents in core location buildings, the trust noted in its earnings report. 
CICT will also be refreshing its malls, with over 50 new stores in Raffles City Singapore following its asset enhancement initiative (AEI) and 10 new brands at Bugis Junction and Bugis+. As recently announced, it is also embarking on a S$62 million AEI to transform CQ @ Clarke Quay.
CICT will continue to explore opportunities that fit its strategic investment criteria, Tan said. However, speaking at a briefing accompanying the result announcement, Tan played down rumours of CICT's interest in the Mercatus portfolio.
Earlier media reports, citing people with knowledge of the matter, claimed that CICT is sounding out sources of financing for the prospective acquisition of NTUC Enterprise Co-operative's S$4 billion portfolio of shopping malls in Singapore. ""I don't know why people speak on our behalf,"" Tan said. ""But if I said we're not looking at it, nobody will believe it, right?""
""It's in our own backyard, in a space we're familiar with, so we'll naturally be interested,"" he noted. ""I would say that there are some interesting elements within the portfolio… There are some pluses and minuses overall."" Tan added that CICT viewed the portfolio as it would any other potential assets.
Units of CICT were trading 0.5 per cent or S$0.01 lower at S$2.13 as at 1.30 pm on Thursday, following the result announcement.

2022-07-29,Ascott Residence Trust H1 DPS up 14% on boost from travel recovery,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/ascott-residence-trust-h1-dps-14-boost-travel-recovery,"THE return of global travel has lifted the fortunes of Ascott Residence Trust : HMN -1.12% (ART), as it recorded a 14 per cent rise in distribution per stapled security (DPS) to S$0.0233 for H1 ended June.

Revenue for the period rose 45 per cent year on year to S$267.4 million, translating to a 44 per cent increase in gross profit to S$118.2 million. This was driven by a higher average daily rate and average occupancy rate; average occupancy rate rose to 70 per cent in Q2, from 50 per cent in the previous quarter. Revenue per available unit (RevPAU) rose strongly, by 60 per cent to S$96 in the first half.

Serena Teo, chief executive officer of the managers of ART, noted that the RevPAU of S$124 in Q2 was about 82 per cent of pre-Covid levels in Q2 2019.
""Based on the forward bookings that we have, we believe that the demand should be able to sustain through to the end of the year,"" she said at a briefing given at the announcement of the results.

Teo added that business travel has recovered to normal pre-Covid levels for ART's markets that have opened their borders - the US, Europe, Australia and Singapore.

""When China opens up, that could become another tailwind,"" she said. She noted that prior to the pandemic, China accounted for 10 per cent of ART's source markets.
The easing of travel in other markets could also give ART a boost in the second half, she added.

""Japan has already opened borders to corporate travel and since then, corporates have been travelling in,"" she said. ""If Japan borders open to leisure travel, we believe that will give an uplift to (ART).""

In H1, ART enjoyed greater contributions from its expanded portfolio of longer-stay assets, comprising student accommodation and rental housing properties, and the newly-opened lyf property in One-North. Its 7 student accommodation properties in the US and 3 rental housing properties in Japan acquired over the last year have an average occupancy rate of over 95 per cent.

Some 32 per cent of ART's H1 gross profit was income from management contracts of serviced residences and hotels. The remainder came from ""stable income"" sources, including master leases, management contracts with minimum guaranteed income, rental housing and student accommodation properties.
The trust's H1 distributions were up 20 per cent to S$76.7 million, including realised exchange gains from repaying foreign currency bank loans. Excluding one-off items, ART's adjusted DPS rose 120 per cent to S$0.0178.

Bob Tan, chairman of ART's 2 managers, said that their serviced residences and hotels have contributed more growth income with the recovery in travel. ""This builds upon the steady income stream from our strong foundation of longer-stay assets. ART's diversified and resilient portfolio remains poised for further growth.

""In addition, our robust financial position gives us the capacity to achieve our asset allocation target of 25-30 per cent in longer-stay assets and 70-75 per cent of our portfolio in serviced residences and hotels,"" he said.

Looking ahead, ART has 2 properties under development. The student accommodation Standard at Columbia in the US is expected to be completed in Q2 in 2023. Construction of the new Somerset serviced residence on the Liang Court site remains on track for completion in H2 in 2025.

The counter closed flat at S$1.17 on Friday, following the announcement."

The manager attributed the higher distribution to a higher net property income contribution, lower finance cost and other gains distribution from the divestment of Village Residence Clarke Quay (VRCQ).

Gross revenue for the first half of FY2022 however, slid 1.4 per cent from S$41.6 million to S$41 million mainly due to the VRCQ divestment, it added.
""Excluding the effect of VRCQ, revenue from the retail and office spaces would have increased 12.6 per cent year on year on a same-store basis,"" the manager added.

Following the disposal of Central Square, which comprises VRCQ as well as office and retail units, revenue from Far East H-Trust's retail and office spaces declined 1.5 per cent to S$7.3 million for H1 2022.

Net property income for the stapled group also saw a growth of 3.5 per cent from S$36.2 million to S$37.5 million in H1 this year.
Income available for distribution rose 14.4 per cent year on year from S$25.3 million to S$29 million in H1 2022.

The DPS is due to be paid out on Sep 6, after books closure on Aug 8.
Average occupancy of the hotels under Far East H-Trust's portfolio fell 68.2 per cent year on year as some hotels, previously used for Covid-19-related isolation, exited from contracts with the government, coupled with the fact that the Elizabeth Hotel was closed for renovation.

While there were early signs of recovery, the hotels were still on the fixed rent component of the master leases, said the stapled group's manager.

Meanwhile, average occupancy for its serviced residences rose 12.3 percentage points to 88.5 per cent on stronger demand supported by corporate groups and from professionals requiring long-stay accommodation, they added.

The aggregate leverage for the trust also decreased from 38.3 per cent in December 2021 to 33.3 per cent in June 2022 after it repaid loans and revolving credit facilities with proceeds from the divestment of Central Square.

""We are encouraged by the increasing flow of leisure and business travel into Singapore and the progressive recovery of the hospitality industry,"" said Gerald Lee, chief executive of the Reit manager.

""While there are macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical risks in the near term, they will be mitigated by the expected improvement in operating performance of our hotels and serviced residences, as well as our plan to distribute a portion of the gains from the divestment of Central Square to stapled securityholders.""

DPU was 1.32 cents for the six months ended Jun 30, compared with 1.30 cents in the same period last year, the interim financial statements of the real estate investment trust (Reit) indicated.
Net property and other income in H1 jumped 40.2 per cent year on year to S$52.7 million, while its distributable amount rose 20.9 per cent year on year to S$25.3 million.
Its manager said this was due to new income contribution from the 12 nursing homes in Japan acquired on Mar 1 as well as from the restructured master-lease agreements for 14 Indonesia hospitals, the manager said.
Victor Tan, executive director and chief executive of the manager, said: ""The injection of the 12 well-established nursing homes in Japan, operated by high-quality local operators, has not only delivered accretive DPU to our unit holders, but also increased the geographical and tenant diversification in our portfolio.""
He added that the Reit is in a stronger financial position following the restructuring of the master lease agreements for the bulk of its Indonesia portfolio.
Among them, 77.3 per cent of its properties have a weighted average lease expiry of more than 10 years.

Its portfolio currently consists of 3 nursing homes in Singapore, 12 in Japan, as well as 12 hospitals and 3 integrated properties in Indonesia.

The Reit had a total debt of S$462.7 million as at Jun 30, compared with S$352.4 million at the end of last year. Its gearing ratio is 35.6 per cent and its weighted average debt to maturity is 1.28 years.

The manager said the Reit is in negotiations with lenders to refinance term loans due March 2023 for the sum of S$252.4 million, or 54.6 per cent of its total debt.
In a commentary on the competition in the industry, the manager noted that the rise in Covid-19 cases in Indonesia have led to a reinstatement of testing for some travellers from Jul 17.
Overall, it said, demand for quality hospital services would continue to be sustained by domestic demand and growing affluence in Indonesia.
In Japan, demand for nursing homes is likely to continue growing, given its ageing population, it said.
It added that First Reit targets for developed markets to comprise more than half its portfolio in 3 to 5 years, and this is being done by divesting non-core, non-healthcare or mature assets such as Siloam Hospitals Surabaya.
Units of First Reit closed flat at S$0.28 on Friday."

Another 15 trusts are expected to announce between Aug 1 to Aug 12.
Last week, 14 S-Reits and property trusts unveiled half year or first quarter financial results ending Jun 30 while another 4 released quarterly business updates. Starhill Global Reit : P40U -1.03% (SGReit) also announced its full year earnings last week.
SGReit reported full year net property income (NPI) of S$144.7 million, increasing 7.4 per cent from last year. As a result, income available for distribution grew 1.8 per cent on a full year basis to S$89.8 million. The Reit manager will retain S$1.9 million of the H2 FY21/22 income available for distribution for working capital requirements.
The Reit manager noted that its Singapore portfolio, comprising interests in Wisma Atria and Ngee Ann City, continue to contribute the bulk of total revenue at 59.9 per cent of total revenue in H2 FY21/22. During the period, Wisma Atria and Ngee Ann City saw significant improvements in tenant sales and shopper traffic with the arrival of international tourists, as well as increased domestic consumption following the relaxation of Covid-19 safe management measures.
For H2 FY21/22, tenant sales and shopper traffic improved 43.6 per cent and 32.1 per cent year on year, respectively. The Reit also noted that tenant sales in Q4 FY21/22 at Wisma Atria even surpassed pre-pandemic sales by 4.8 per cent over the corresponding period in Q4 FY18/19.
As of Jun 30, 2022, the gearing ratio of SGReit is maintained at 36.2 per cent with about 93 per cent of its debts on a fixed or hedged basis. The Reit believes that its prudent capital management approach has allowed it to buffer pressures brought about by global inflation concerns and rising interest rates. It remains cautiously optimistic that the Asia-Pacific retail and commercial real estate markets will continue to grow. SGX RESEARCH"

It has a 'buy' call on the counter.
The trust last week posted a 14 per cent rise in distribution per stapled security (DPS) to S$0.0233 for H1 ended June. Excluding one-offs, adjusted DPS had jumped 120 per cent, noted analyst Chua Su Tye in a Monday (Aug 1) report.
Its properties in France and the UK have outperformed pre-pandemic levels, Chua highlighted, adding that management sees room for stronger revenue per available unit (RevPAU) recoveries in Japan and China in H2.
The research house is now assuming 40 per cent growth in RevPAU, as opposed to 25 per cent year-on-year. It also expects a stronger performance in H2, as compared to the first half of the year. In line with this, Chua raised his forecasts by 7-8 per cent.
""We like ART's diversified portfolio, concentrated longer-stay assets, strong balance sheet, and S$300 million in residual divestment gains to support capital distributions amid an uneven DPU recovery,"" he said.
The trust's acquisitions have also lifted contributions from stable income sources to 68 per cent of H1 gross profit, as opposed to 64 per cent in H2 FY2021, Chua noted. Rental housing and student accommodation assets added from last year saw occupancy rates that exceeded 95 per cent, with 3 of the 7 US properties fully-occupied.
ART's gearing is stable at 37.5 per cent, with the proportion of fixed-rate debt remaining high at 79 per cent. Maybank expects that a 50 basis point increase in base rate could lower ART's DPU by less than 2 per cent.
Chua added: ""We see a S$1.8 billion debt headroom supporting acquisitions, with the new CEO looking to leverage on ART's strong financial fundamentals to drive growth on its more resilient, long-stay assets under management.""
ART was trading flat at S$1.17 on Monday as of 10.48am."

""This is one exceptional quarter. We have capitalised very much on this and pushed rental up as high as possible, to what is acceptable,"" said William Tay, chief executive officer of the real estate investment trust (Reit) manager, at a briefing delivered with the announcement of the results. ""Generally, the market has moved up, and enquiries have strengthened.""
A-Reit's average rental reversion for the second quarter ended June came in at a strong 13.2 per cent across its portfolio. This brought rental reversion for H1 to 9.4 per cent.
The Reit manager has raised its guidance for rental reversion for the full year to be in the ""positive mid-single-digit range"".

""Other than this quarter, moving forward, we'll still be expecting the 3-5 per cent rental reversion in Singapore, which is quite typical. And given the fact that the economy is still growing, I think we should be able to hit that kind of numbers,"" Tay said.
Gross revenue was up 13.7 per cent to S$666.5 million for the half-year period, from S$586 million a year ago.
The increase was mainly attributable to contributions from newly acquired properties in Singapore, the United Kingdom and Europe, the United States and Australia, as well as a built-to-suit development in Singapore during FY 2021 and H1 2022, the Reit manager said in a regulatory filing.

Net property income (NPI) grew at a slower pace of 7 per cent on the year to S$476.9 million for the half year, from S$445.6 million a year ago, as higher net utilities expenses from the Singapore properties partially offset the increase in gross revenue.

Total amount available for distribution rose 6.3 per cent year on year to S$330.7 million, from S$311 million.

As previously guided, Tay said utility costs for FY2022 are expected to be 50-70 per cent higher than a year ago.

He explained that utilities costs accounted for about 20 per cent of operating expenses in FY2021.

""In this half - possibly because of the reopening - consumption has gone up. Total utilities is about 23 per cent of operating expenses, with 6 per cent relating to landlord's costs."" Tay said.

He added that A-Reit is raising its service charges from October to mitigate the impact of rising utilities costs.

As at end June, A-Reit's overall portfolio occupancy rate improved to 94 per cent, from 92.6 per cent at end March. This was driven by improvements in Singapore, the US and the UK and Europe.

In response to questions from analysts and the media, Tay said A-Reit was ""unlikely"" to hit S$1 billion worth of acquisitions this year.

The Reit completed S$223.4 million of acquisitions in the first half of FY2022.

""We are still in the market looking for inorganic growth, but it is likely to be in smaller chunks,"" Tay said.

The distribution of 7.873 cents per unit for the period Jan 1 to Jun 30, 2022 will be paid on Sep 5 after the books are closed on Aug 11.

Units of A-Reit closed S$2.96 on Tuesday, down 0.3 per cent or S$0.01 before the results release."
2022-08-03,"Ascott Residence Trust retains corporate governance crown for Reits, business trusts",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/ascott-residence-trust-retains-corporate-governance-crown-reits-business-trusts,"ASCOTT Residence Trust (ART), the largest hospitality real estate investment trust (Reit) in Asia-Pacific, has topped the ranking among Singapore-listed Reits and business trusts for best corporate governance practices for the second straight year.

A stapled group comprising Ascott Real Estate Investment Trust and Ascott Business Trust, ART scored a total of 110.6 points for the 2022 edition of the Singapore Governance and Transparency Index.

On top of corporate governance practices, the annual study - jointly conducted by CPA Australia, the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School's Centre for Governance and Sustainability (CGS) and the Singapore Institute of Directors (SID) - also evaluates Singapore-listed companies on the timeliness, accessibility and transparency of their financial disclosures.


Companies were evaluated based on their board responsibilities, rights of shareholders, engagement of stakeholders, accountability and audit, and disclosure and transparency.

In addition, the 44 Reits and business trusts were scored on their structure, leverage, interested person transactions, competency of Reit manager or trustee-manager, and emoluments.
SID chair Wong Su-Yen noted that there was ""growing awareness of the importance of good corporate governance"" among Singapore-listed companies.
""It is heartening to see the improvements our companies have made despite the disruption to business-as-usual over the past 2 years,"" she said. ""This is… a testament to the efforts of all the companies in the industry, not just those at the top, to improve their corporate governance practices in Singapore.""
While ART retained its crown, it was a case of musical chairs among the other Reits and business trusts in the top 5.
Ascendas Real Estate Investment Trust (A-Reit) overtook 2021 runner-up Far East Hospitality Trust (FEHT) to claim second place in the ranking this year, while CapitaLand Intergated Commercial Trust (CICT) nudged past Netlink NBN Trust to rank fourth.

All the top 5 trusts received lower overall scores this year compared with 2021.

ART's winning score this year was 4.7 points lower than the 115.3 points it chalked up in 2021.

The 2022 scores for A-Reit (108.7), FEHT (107.4), CICT (107.2) and Netlink NBN Trust (105.2) were also between 1.2 and 6.4 points lower than their year-ago scores.

However, the average overall score for all the Singapore-listed Reits and business trusts inched up marginally to 85.3 points in 2022, from 85 points last year.

Since the launch of the Reits and business trusts category in 2017, there has been an improvement in the mean scores for each year.

The Reits and business trusts scored an average of 60.4 points in the inaugural edition in 2017.

""The improvement in corporate governance, as evidenced by the improving mean scores of the index, can be attributed to 2 main factors,"" said Professor Lawrence Loh, director of NUS Business School's CGS.

""First, the accountability required by companies on sustainability matters has spurred better corporate governance in recent years. Second, guidelines for corporate governance in Singapore is placing more emphasis on directors' responsibilities and independence in matters relating to governance and transparency,"" he said."

This comes as the stapled group posts a distributable income of US$8.1 million, unlike the previous year when there was no distributable income. ARA H-Trust resumed paying distributions in H2 2021.

The capital distributions represent a return of capital to stapled securityholders for Singapore income tax purposes, the managers said in a bourse filing. The DPS will be paid on Sep 26, after the record date on Aug 18.
Net property income jumped 131.2 per cent to US$21.1 million, from US$9.1 million in the corresponding period a year ago, as revenue rose 53.8 per cent.

Revenue for H1 2022 stood at US$81.3 million compared with the US$52.8 million recorded in H1 2021, as portfolio occupancy improved and revenue per available room (RevPAR) grew.
The portfolio posted an average occupancy of 62.7 per cent and average daily rate of US$127, while RevPAR was up 54 per cent to US$80.

The surge in average daily rate allowed hotel revenue growth to outpace the increase in expenses, mitigating inflation concerns on margins, said Lee Jin Yong, chief executive of the managers.

ARA H-Trust also saw its operating cash flows improve in the last 6 months. Interest coverage ratio for the half-year period strengthened further to 2.8 times, raising the gearing limit to 50 per cent. It also had around US$19.8 million in cash and cash equivalents as at Jun 30, and about US$15 million of undrawn loan facilities.

In the Reits and business trusts category, Ascott Residence Trust : HMN -1.12% retained its top position with an overall score of 110.6. Ascendas Reit : A17U 0% overtook Far East Hospitality Trust : Q5T -0.84% this year with 108.7 points, with the latter ranked third at 107.4 points. Lendlease Global Commercial Reit, : JYEU +0.98% whose score improved 6.0 points, made it to the top 10 this year.

Findings by the SGTI highlighted year-on-year improvements in practices for interested person transaction (IPT) and performance fees. Moreover, the proportion of trusts that had a minimum of 3 full-time representatives with at least 5 years of relevant management experience improved from 91 per cent to 98 per cent. SGTI notes that Reits and business trusts, given their unique business models, are subjected to additional guidelines such as the Code on Collective Investment Schemes, hence complementing the existing SGTI framework (e.g. leverage, structure, IPT, competency of manager, fees).


Results pertaining to sustainability-related disclosures were also commendable with 84 per cent of trusts disclosing their non-financial performance indicators compared to 77 per cent last year.

Overall, the mean score of the Reits and business trust category increased by 0.3 points year on year and the mean bonus points for good disclosure practices increased by 0.7 points to 19.2 points. Mean penalty points for poor disclosure practices, such as discrepancies in corporate announcements, rose 0.3 points to 5.4 points.

The top 5 Reits and property trusts with the most year-on-year improvements in overall scores include: Keppel DC Reit : AJBU -0.49% (+17.5 points), Frasers Hospitality Trust : ACV 0% (+13.4 points), Sabana Industrial Reit : M1GU +1.3% (+13.3 points), First Reit : AW9U +2.17% (+12.0 points) and Dasin Retail Trust : CEDU 0% (+9.7 points).
The SGTI is an annual assessment of Singapore-listed companies on their corporate governance disclosure and practices, as well as the timeliness, accessibility, and transparency of their financial results announcement. With increased scrutiny on corporate stewardship, SGTI offers stakeholders insights into the accountability and transparency of companies.

It is a collaboration among CPA Australia, NUS Business School's Centre for Governance and Sustainability, and the Singapore Institute of Directors, supported by The Business Times.

The SGTI 2022, which assessed companies based on their annual reports for Financial Year 2021 released by May 31, 2022, is divided into 2 categories - general category (489 companies) and the Reits and business trusts category (44 trusts).

The mean overall scores of both categories reached all-time highs of 70.6 (general category) and 85.3 (Reits and business trusts category) respectively, with improvements across all 5 pillars of the assessment framework. "

This brings DPU for the first half to S$0.0018, up 5.9 per cent from S$0.0017 in the year-ago period.
Gross revenue rose 4.1 per cent to S$51.7 million in Q2, on the back of higher rental revenue as lower rental discounts were extended due to the stabilising Covid-19 situation in Indonesia.
The increase was partially offset by the expiry of the master lease at Lippo Mall Kuta and the loss of rental income due to lower occupancy.
Portfolio occupancy inched up to 79.7 per cent in Q2, from 79.1 per cent in the preceding quarter. However, this was a decline from portfolio occupancy of 83.4 per cent a year ago.
The real estate investment trust (Reit) manager said the lower year-on-year occupancy was due to the termination of leases from tenants impacted by the pandemic.Net property income was 8.8 per cent higher year on year at S$34.6 million, largely attributable to a net reversal of allowance for impairment loss on trade receivables of S$1.8 million.
""As Indonesia gradually transitions from pandemic to endemic phase, the easing of restrictions has enabled our malls to resume normal operating hours with most of our tenants back in operations,"" said James Liew, chief executive officer of the manager of LMIR Trust.
""Operationally, as consumers get used to living with Covid, we are seeing more favourable consumer spending as well as a recovery in shopper traffic to our malls for the quarter,"" he added.

Liew noted that shopper traffic to LMIR Trust's malls have recovered to nearly two-thirds of pre-Covid levels.

Units of LMIR Trust closed flat at S$0.049 on Monday, before the results announcement."

Gross revenue was also 68.6 per cent higher at S$62.5 million, following the acquisition of Jem in the second half of FY2022.
Net property income (NPI) for the real estate investment trust (Reit) grew 72.9 per cent year on year to S$45.9 million in H2, from S$26.5 million earlier.
The total amount distributable to unitholders rose 55.6 per cent to S$42.9 million in H2 FY2022 from S$27.6 million a year ago, boosted by the accretive acquisition of Jem and better operating performance at 313@somerset.
The final distribution for the period from Mar 31 to Jun 30 will be paid out by Sep 30.
Meanwhile, for the full year ended Jun 30, DPU was 3.7 per cent higher at S$0.0485, versus S$0.0468 last year. Distributable income grew 29.7 per cent to S$71.5 million. Gross revenue was 29.3 per cent higher at S$101.7 million, while NPI rose 32.7 per cent to S$75.5 million for the full year.
As at Jun 30, the group's aggregate gearing stands at 40 per cent with an interest coverage ratio of 9.2 times.

Full-year portfolio occupancy weighed in at 99.8 per cent, while its weighted average lease expiry by gross rental income is around 5.5 years.

Commenting on its Milan office assets, the manager said: ""A faster recovery from Covid-19 and the increasing demand for spaces in line with ESG requirements should continue to support investment and leasing activities for the sector.""

For its Singapore offices, the manager expects rental growth in the mid-term to be supported by the rapid expansion in demand from the technology sector and limited new supply, with vacancy tightening further before the next wave of office supply in 2023.

Its fully leased office assets will continue to benefit and enjoy strong and stable cashflow, they added.

The manager was also confident that the Reit would benefit from an ""increased exposure in the suburban retail segment and the high concentration in the essential services trade"" as trade and travel-related sectors pick up pace post-Covid-19.

2022-08-10,Brokers’ take: Morningstar initiates Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust with S$1.82 fair value estimate,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/brokers-take-morningstar-initiates-mapletree-pan-asia-commercial-trust-s182-fair,"MORNINGSTAR Equity Research has initiated coverage on Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust : N2IU +0.74% (MPACT) with a fair value estimate of S$1.82 and a no-moat rating. It believes the trust is ""fairly valued"" at current prices and has priced in near-term growth driven by the merger with Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust (MNACT).
The research house on Monday (Aug 8) forecasted MPACT's revenue and net property income to grow at a 5-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.5 and 19.6 per cent respectively, taking the merger with MNACT into account.
Analyst Xavier Lee noted that both MPACT's retail malls - Vivocity and Festival Walk - had maintained close to 100 per cent occupancy rates every year, even during the pandemic, as well as register positive rental reversions for most years.

""Both malls are close to mass transport hubs helping to generate a high volume of shopper footfall and to drive sales growth for its tenant base,"" Lee said.

Further, the trust's office properties, while largely located outside of the central business district, are of high quality, well-supported by amenities and connected to key transport networks, he added.
Lee expects rental income from its offices to grow steadily, supported by fixed annual rental escalations of between 2 and 3 per cent as well as relatively high occupancy rate of around 97 per cent.

Even though market rents in the office segment are expected to remain under pressure in the near term, the analyst thinks the sector is due to recover in 2024 as Covid-19 restrictions lift and Singapore and Hong Kong both re-open its borders.

Morningstar was however less upbeat on the trust's office properties in China, given their geographical position in areas that are experiencing high vacancy rates of above 10 per cent - which could weigh down its rents.

""We expect near-term rents to remain flat until the excess supply is absorbed,"" said Lee.

He predicted that distribution per unit for the trust would grow at a CAGR of 2.7 per cent over the next 5 years, slower than its 10-year historic CAGR of 4.4 per cent due to higher borrowing costs from rising interest rates.

Units of MPACT last traded at S$1.92, 0.5 per cent or S$0.01 lower as at the midday trading break on Wednesday."

Income to be distributed to unitholders fell 32.7 per cent to S$3.9 million, from S$5.8 million in the previous year.

The H1 distribution will be paid to unitholders on Sep 28.
Gross revenue rose 3.6 per cent to S$35.6 million, while net property income edged up 1.8 per cent to S$21 million.
The increase was mainly due to an increase in portfolio occupancy to 96.7 per cent in H1, from 93 per cent in the year-ago period.

In Singapore, the S-Reits and property trusts sector gained 4.9 per cent in total returns and received S$8 million of net institutional inflows during this period.

The sector's performance was led by trusts within the data centre, industrial and diversified sub-segments. These 3 sub-segments averaged 12 per cent, 8.2 per cent and 4 per cent respectively in total returns in the Q3 2022-to-date.

The top 5 performing trusts in Q3 2022-to-date were Digital Core Reit : DCRU +0.99% (18.3 per cent), Daiwa House Logistics Trust : DHLU -0.91% (18 per cent), EC World Reit : BWCU 0% (16.7 per cent), Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust : BUOU +0.94% (9 per cent) and Ascendas India Trust : CY6U 0% (8.5 per cent).
Digital Core Reit, a pure-play data centre S-Reit which listed in December 2021, reported its first half-year financial results and declared a distribution per unit (DPU) of 2.37 US cents for the period from Dec 6, 2021 to Jun 30, 2022. Its portfolio value stands at US$1.46 billion with a 100 per cent occupancy rate. The Reit will be targeting new markets such as Frankfurt, Chicago and Dallas for acquisitions.
Daiwa House Logistics Trust, which also listed in 2021, has a portfolio of 14 logistics assets across Japan, valued at 81 billion yen (S$832 million). The trust announced a DPU of 3.09 Singapore cents for the period from Nov 26, 2021 to Jun 30, 2022. The trust manager believes that while a large supply of logistics space is expected in 2022 and 2023, demand is expected to remain buoyant due to business expansions, relocation for more efficient network, obsolescence of current existing facilities, and increase in the volume of storage goods.

EC World Reit reported H1 2022 net property income (NPI) of S$57.9 million, registering a year-on-year growth of 4.2 per cent, and H1 2022 DPU of 2.77 Singapore cents, representing a year-on-year decline of 9.6 per cent. The Reit manager noted that recent lockdowns in China which occurred in the second quarter, did not have material impact on the Reit. EC World Reit believes that domestic demand in China will continue to grow, with online retail set to increase faster than offline retail in 2022. The Reit will continue to focus on its e-commerce and downstream logistics properties to capture the pent-up demand for logistics services and warehousing facilities.
Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust in its Q3 2022 business update noted that it achieved full occupancy rate for its logistics and industrial assets while commercial assets maintained occupancy rates of 91.3 per cent. The trust believes that the overall operating environment is expected to further improve and observed strong tenant activity as countries continue to adopt an endemic approach to living with Covid-19 with a progressive return towards normalcy.

Ascendas India Trust reported a 9 per cent year-on-year increase for H1 2022 NPI and declared H1 2022 DPU of 4.28 Singapore cents, representing an increase of 2 per cent year on year. The trust noted that the stronger performance was backed by higher occupancy in major IT parks and observed an increase in physical park population, as India resumes normalcy."
2022-08-21,Latest S-Reit acquisitions in industrial and hospitality sectors,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/latest-s-reit-acquisitions-industrial-and-hospitality-sectors,"S-REIT acquisitions have started to pick up in the year to date despite rising rates, with over 18 deals announced exceeding S$4 billion in total purchase consideration. A number of acquisitions announced were in sectors such as industrial/logistics, office properties, data centres, and hospitality sectors.

Cromwell European Reit (CEReit) : CWBU -0.79% in July announced the proposed acquisition of its third logistics asset in the United Kingdom. The freehold logistics property is situated within the Whitehouse Industrial Estate in Preston Brook, south-east of Runcorn, and well-positioned in a distribution location for UK logistics and industrial occupiers including neighbouring operations such as Diageo, YKK, DHL and Phoenix medical supplies. The property is fully occupied on a 10-year triple net lease and the tenancy includes a retail price index-linked rent review at year 5 subject to terms.

CEReit notes that the UK's logistics sector's Q1 2022 vacancy is at 3.1 per cent and average rents continued to grow 11.4 per cent in the year-to-March 2022. In terms of industrial investment values, Q1 2022 was at £3.3 billion (S$5.4 billion) and is the second highest first quarter on record just after Q1 2021's £3.7 billion. CEReit's portfolio currently has 44 per cent exposure to light industrial/logistics, advancing its strategy of pivoting towards this sector.
Ascendas India Trust : CY6U 0% also announced in July that it is investing in 2 industrial facilities, part of Casa Grande Phase 2, at Mahindra World City in Chennai. This acquisition is in addition to the earlier forward purchase transaction of an industrial facility, Casa Grande Phase 1, which was completed in May 2022. The trust will fund the development of the Phase 2 project, and upon completion and meeting key conditions, will acquire the entity developing the project.

Ascendas India Trust believes that the acquisition will improve earnings and distributions for unitholders with the pro forma impact on FY21 distribution per unit (DPU) expected to be an additional 0.01 Singapore cent.
Ascendas Reit : A17U 0% announced that it will be acquiring the Philips Apac Center in Singapore from Philips Electronics which will enter a multi-year leaseback of more than two-thirds of the existing space to become the anchor tenant. The property is leased to a total of 4 tenants and has an occupancy rate of 95.7 per cent and a long weighted average lease to expiry of 4.5 years.

The pro forma impact on the DPU for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2021 is expected to be an accretive 0.045 Singapore cent assuming the proposed acquisition was completed on Jan 1, 2021.

Ascott Residence Trust (ART) : HMN -1.12% announced the proposed acquisition of 9 properties from its sponsor, The Ascott, which includes serviced residences, rental housing and student accommodation across Australia, Japan, Vietnam, France and the United States. The acquisition is expected to grow the trust's pro forma FY21 distribution per stapled security by 2.8 per cent and its total assets to S$8.3 billion. To fund the acquisition, ART launched a private placement last week raising S$170 million.

ART notes that the addition of the 5 rental housing properties in Japan and a student accommodation in the US will increase its longer-stay portfolio proportion from 17 per cent to 19 per cent, bringing it closer to its target of 25 per cent to 30 per cent. Three of the assets to be acquired are expected to be certified green by 2023, bringing its proportion of green properties to 38 per cent, in line with its target to reach 50 per cent of its portfolio by 2025.
In the August month-to-date, Ascendas Reit and Ascott Residence Trust both announced proposed acquisitions."
2022-08-19,Opportunity for S-Reits as student accommodation sector tops the class,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/opportunity-s-reits-student-accommodation-sector-tops-class,"PURPOSE-BUILT student accommodation (PBSA) is gaining traction as a resilient asset class among property players.

There are currently no pure-play PBSA property groups and real estate investment trusts (Reits) listed in Singapore. But the strength of this sub-sector in the latest earnings season for the period ended June suggests this may soon change.

For example, hospitality player Ascott Residence Trust (ART), a stapled group comprising Ascott Reit and Ascott Business Trust, posted a 45 per cent increase in revenue for the first half ended June to S$267.4 million, and a 44 per cent rise in gross profit to S$118.2 million.
This was partially attributed to contributions from new properties, including the first full half-year of income contribution from 5 PBSA properties in the US, acquired in the second half of 2021.

ART said its PBSA properties in the US registered an average occupancy of over 95 per cent in H1, with an expected rent growth of close to 8 per cent year on year.

The service residence-focused Reit made its maiden foray into the PBSA space last year, and has since been steadily adding more such assets under its belt.
Apart from the US, ART also completed the acquisition of its first student accommodation property in Japan in March.

This week, the Singapore-listed real estate investment trust (S-Reit) announced the proposed acquisition of 9 properties from sponsor The Ascott Limited for S$318.3 million.

This includes the proposed acquisition of an additional 45 per cent stake in Standard at Columbia - a student accommodation asset in South Carolina currently being built and slated for completion in Q2 2023.

The latest acquisitions will bring ART's longer-stay assets - comprising rental housing and student accommodation - to about 19 per cent of its total portfolio value. The managers target for this longer-stay segment to make up 25-30 per cent of ART's portfolio in the medium term.

The segment accounted for about 20 per cent of H1 gross profit.

Meanwhile, specialised accommodation assets player Centurion Corp, which derived a quarter of its H1 revenue from its PBSA properties in the UK, Australia, the US and South Korea, reported a 43 per cent jump in PBSA revenue for the first half to S$22.5 million.

Earnings from its core business operations - excluding fair-valuation gains and deferred tax relating to fair valuation - were up 42 per cent to S$29 million, as total group revenue rose 40 per cent to S$90.5 million in H1.

Centurion said the improvement in PBSA results was largely due to higher bookings and financial occupancies at its PBSA assets, led by the lifting of travel restrictions and a return of international students.

Far East Orchard, another real estate group with exposure to the PBSA sector, also posted a commendable set of results in the latest period.

The group reversed into the black with earnings of S$8 million for the H1 ended June, as revenue rose 15.9 per cent to S$63.7 million.

The increase was partially attributed to higher revenue from its PBSA segment, on the back of a higher occupancy rate of 85 per cent for the academic year that started in September 2021.

In June, the group announced a joint venture to acquire a plot of land in Bristol in the UK to develop a PBSA asset with at least 690 beds - marking its 4th investment in the city.

The defensive, cash-yielding nature of PBSA properties has drawn plenty of interest from the big players.

Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC has been scooping up PBSA assets, including a joint venture with Greystar Real Estate Partners in May to acquire Student Roost, the 3rd-largest PBSA provider in the UK.

Temasek-linked Mapletree Investments had also been evaluating various options to monetise its portfolio of student accommodation assets, with rumours swirling over a potential US$1 billion initial public offering (IPO) of a student housing Reit this year.

A Reit focusing on PBSA properties could be welcomed globally, due to its short supply despite the perceived resilience.

The US this year lost its last publicly traded student housing Reit, with the acquisition of American Campus Communities by Blackstone.

US-listed EdR was acquired by Greystar in 2018, and Campus Crest was snapped up by Harrison Street in 2015.

As far as student accommodation Reits go, London Stock Exchange-listed Unite Group and Empiric Student Property are holding the fort globally.

Unite Group and Empiric Student Property have performed well so far this year, with annualised total returns of 8.3 per cent and 29.1 per cent, respectively, in the year to date.
By comparison, iEdge S-Reit Index has returned 0.8 per cent on an annualised basis over the same period.

The UK duo was joined by a much smaller reit, US Student Housing Reit, which made its debut on the Australian Securities Exchange in March and is still finding its footing.

But with the PBSA sector seen to be mostly bullish, it might be an opportune time for a pure-play student accommodation Reit to be listed in Singapore."
2022-08-28,Outperformance in S-Reits in STI reserve list,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/outperformance-s-reits-sti-reserve-list,"WITH a 7.6 per cent gain in total returns for the year-to-date, the Straits Times Index (STI) remained among the best performing stock benchmarks globally this year. Based on data from FTSE Russell as at Jun 30, 2022, there are 7 S-Reits in the STI with combined indicative weight of more than 14 per cent. For the June 2022 quarterly review, FTSE Russell announced that there were no changes to the constituents of the STI and the next review is expected to take place in early September 2022.

Post the June review, the STI reserve list, which consists of the 5 highest ranking non-constituents of the STI, were: Olam International, Suntec Reit, Keppel Reit, Frasers Centrepoint Trust and Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust (MNACT). Four out of the 5 stocks in the STI reserve list were in the S-Reits and Property Trusts sector. The stocks on the reserve list will replace any STI constituents that become ineligible as a result of corporate actions before the next review.

With the merger of Mapletree Commercial Trust and MNACT to form Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust (MPACT), MNACT is expected to be replaced in the STI reserve list during the upcoming September review while the index weight of MPACT is also expected to be revised.
The 3 remaining S-Reits in the STI reserve list saw average year-to-date total returns of 4.4 per cent, outperforming the 7 S-Reits constituents within the STI, which saw average declines of 3.6 per cent during the same period.

Suntec Reit, in its latest 1H2022 financial release, declared distribution per unit (DPU) of 4.810 cents for the period, which was 15.8 per cent higher year-on-year. The Reit attributed the higher DPU to better gross revenue, which grew 22 per cent year-on-year, and net property income (NPI), which increased 35.8 per cent year-on-year. This was driven mainly by contributions from The Minster Building and Nova Properties in London as well as Suntec City in Singapore.

Suntec Reit's manager observed good recovery of businesses at Suntec City Mall and Suntec Convention. It also noted that with the easing of safe management measures in April 2022, both mall traffic and tenant sales posted strong growth, with tenant sales exceeding pre-pandemic levels for 3 consecutive months from April to June. The Reit is also expecting strong revenue contribution from its Singapore office portfolio, driven by tight vacancy and limited supply with continual demand from Technology, Media and Telecommunications and Financial Services sectors.
Keppel Reit, in its latest 1H2022 financial release, noted that distribution to unitholders grew 4.6 per cent year-on year to $110.5 million while DPU for the period increased 1.0 per cent year-on-year to 2.97 cents. During the period, Keppel Reit secured a new A$100 million green loan facility, bringing its total green borrowings to approximately half of its total borrowings.

Frasers Centrepoint Trust (FCT), in its latest 3Q2022 business update, noted that its retail portfolio committed occupancy eased slightly from 2Q2022 largely due to pre-termination by an anchor tenant, but maintained at a healthy rate of 97.1 per cent. The trust is in advanced negotiations with replacement tenants for this space. FCT also noted that its 3Q2022 tenants' sales and shopper traffic grew 23 per cent and 32 per cent year-on-year respectively."
2022-08-29,Be alert to Reits using leverage and paying fees in units to prop up distribution per unit,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/be-alert-reits-using-leverage-and-paying-fees-units-prop-distribution-unit,"NUMEROUS Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (Reits) posted growth in distribution per unit (DPU) from a year ago for the latest quarter or half-year ended June 2022. Some trusts are benefiting from Singapore's opening up amid living with Covid.

DPU matters greatly to many Reit investors - typically, this is money that is paid out to the investors. For retirees, receiving recurring distribution income from Reits, which may grow over time, is very useful, especially with rising inflation.

Still, many Reit managers expressed caution on the path ahead. Several managers were at pains to highlight efforts made to manage their borrowings amid rising interest rates, such as having a high proportion of fixed rate debt, a long average debt maturity and well-spread out debt maturities.
Like many businesses, Reits benefited from low borrowing costs. The DPU of Reits could be boosted by trusts taking on more borrowings at low interest rates. Perhaps it is useful for investors, who focus on DPU, to understand how the use of leverage and payment of fees to the manager in the form of units can be used to boost a Reit's DPU.
Typically, a Reit owns a portfolio of properties, which is bought by using a mix of debt and equity, with unitholders of the trust contributing the equity.
Often, rental income contributes almost all of gross revenue. Net property income (NPI) is derived after deducting property operating expenses from revenue. Distribution income is the NPI less expenses such as debt costs and management fees. Distribution income is divided by the number of Reit units outstanding to get the DPU.

If interest costs on debt is less than the NPI yield, using more debt will boost the returns that a Reit's unitholders can receive. Generally, using more floating rate debt instead of fixed rate debt helps lower debt cost. However, when interest rates rise, a trust, which borrows more at floating rather than fixed rates, is less insulated from the adverse impact of rising interest rates.
Many Reits pay their managers fees via a mix of cash and new units of the Reit. The initial public offering prospectuses of Singapore's two newest Reits - Daiwa House Logistics Trust (DHLT) and Digital Core Reit (DC Reit) - show that the management fee, which comprises base fee and performance fee, as well as the acquisition fee and divestment fee payable to the manager can be paid via cash and/or units as the manager may elect.

With DHLT, the manager will collect 50 per cent of the base fee and performance fee, if any, in the form of units and the remaining 50 per cent of the fees in cash for 2022. The manager of DC Reit will collect 100 per cent of the base fee and performance fee in the form of units for 2022 and 2023.

Where a Reit pays its manager fees in cash, this expense reduces the distributable income. If a Reit pays its manager fees in units, there is no immediate hit to the distributable income. In such an instance, the number of units in issue rises, which can negatively impact the DPU in future.
I ran a simulation to analyse the impact of the use of leverage and payment of fees to the manager in units on dpu. I assumed that a Reit owns S$2 billion of property that generates NPI yield of 4.5 per cent. I used borrowing costs of 2.5 per cent per annum, annual management fees of 0.6 per cent of assets and other expenses of S$2 million.

Under Scenario A, the Reit is funded 80 per cent by equity and 20 per cent by debt, and the manager's fees are paid all in cash. Under Scenario B, the Reit is funded 60 per cent by equity and 40 per cent by debt, and the manager's fees are paid all in units.

The result, as shown in the table, is that DPU under Scenario B is 37 per cent higher than under Scenario A. An investor, who focuses on DPU, may price a Reit structured along the lines of that in Scenario B much more richly than that in Scenario A.

But there can be costs related to using more debt and paying fees via units. When a Reit uses more debt, there is less capacity to borrow more in order to fund a potentially attractive investment opportunity, as Reits have to adhere to borrowing limits under Singapore's framework.

If credit market conditions tighten, the refinancing risk when loans mature is higher for a more highly-geared Reit. Also, a more highly-geared Reit risks breaching borrowing limits should property valuations fall substantially.

The issuing of new Reit units to pay the manager's fees can dilute the interest of existing unitholders and hamper the rate of DPU growth. Some Reit investors may also be less sensitive to the amount of fees that are being paid to the manager in such a situation. For a Reit that trades below book value, issuing new units based on market price means new equity is being issued at less than book value, which may not make sense.

Reits are structured real estate products. Clever structuring can prop up the return being generated from the underlying real estate, be it from using rental income support, paying fees in units or using debt among others.

Much as DPU matters, investors may do well to place as much emphasis on the net asset value (NAV) per unit. So long as the valuations behind the NAV are robust, the NAV gives a good estimation of the value of the assets in the Reit that can be potentially realised.

While it is hard to buy a physical property in Singapore at below market value, one can find Reits that trade at a substantial discount to NAV. Some Reits that trade below book value may offer superior value to buying physical properties and thus merit serious consideration by investors."
2022-09-01,"Industrial S-Reits flex buying power, in signal of their counter-cyclical strength",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/industrial-s-reits-flex-buying-power-signal-their-counter-cyclical,"DESPITE concerns over surging inflation and interest rates, acquisitions by Singapore-listed Real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) - led by those in the industrial space - are bolstering sentiment that the worst could soon be over for this segment of the local market.

The deals announced may also be an indication of where investors should focus their attention as the S-Reit market falters.

ESR-Logos Reit : J91U +1.85% on Aug 29 announced the proposed acquisition of a 5-storey modern logistics asset in Japan for a purchase consideration of 17.8 billion yen (S$183.5 million), inclusive of rental support.
The transaction - the first direct asset acquisition from its sponsor following the merger between ESR-Reit and Ara Logos Logistics Trust - is expected to be 2.9 per cent accretive to distribution per unit (DPU) on a pro forma basis.

This was the second acquisition announced by an industrial S-Reit in August.

Ascendas Real Estate Investment Trust : A17U 0% (A-Reit) on Aug 4 said it is acquiring the Philips Apac Center in Singapore for S$104.8 million.
On a pro forma basis, the proposed acquisition is expected to be 0.3 per cent accretive to DPU.

Interestingly, A-Reit's announcement of the proposed acquisition came just 2 days after it released its results for the first half ended June.

At a briefing accompanying the results announcement on Aug 2, chief executive officer of the Reit manager William Tay noted that A-Reit was ""unlikely"" to hit S$1 billion worth of acquisitions this year, and that any inorganic growth would likely be in ""smaller chunks"".

Indeed, the slowdown in acquisitions by S-Reits this year has been glaring.

Fewer than 20 deals have been announced, with total purchase consideration of around S$5 billion.

With two-thirds of the year over, it is unlikely that S-Reit acquisitions will come close to the 50-odd asset acquisitions announced in 2021, which exceeded S$12.7 billion in total purchase consideration.

""With the current volatility, market acquisitions are likely to be more piecemeal in nature rather than (by) portfolio, as the latter involves extended time frame and premium valuations, which are unfavourable in current market conditions,"" said RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan in a recent report.

Notably, however, over half of the number of announced acquisitions in the year to date have been in the industrial and logistics space.

The recent acquisition announcements also come on the back of a steady set of results for the industrial S-Reits.

For example, A-Reit, Singapore's largest listed business space and industrial Reit, posted a 2.8 per cent rise in DPU for H1 to 7.873 cents, as gross revenue rose 13.7 per cent to S$666.5 million. Net property income was up 7 per cent to S$476.8 million.

One of the key highlights in A-Reit's latest results was a positive 13.2 per cent average rental reversion for the second quarter ended June, bringing rental reversion for H1 to 9.4 per cent.

The Reit manager raised its guidance for rental reversion for the full year to be in the ""positive mid-single-digit range"", up from a positive low-single-digit range previously.

Overall portfolio occupancy rate also improved 1.4 percentage points quarter on quarter to 94 per cent as at end-June.

Even if the pace of acquisitions remains markedly slower this year, market watchers see room for the Reit to continue to thrive.

""Having acquired more than S$2.1 billion in assets in FY21, A-Reit is on track to deliver DPU growth of close to 4.6 per cent in FY22,"" said DBS analysts Dale Lai and Derek Tan in a recent report.

The analysts added that, beyond acquisitions, A-Reit could also rejuvenate its sizeable portfolio to add value to older properties and tap unutilised plot ratios, which will create a further upside to earnings.

""We believe that investors have not priced the net asset value (NAV) uplift from the redevelopment of its other Science Park assets into properties with higher specifications and higher plot ratios,"" they said. ""The redevelopment of 1 Science Park Drive together with its sponsor paves the way for close to S$5.6 billion in gross development value to be unlocked from its assets at Science Parks 1 and 2."""
2022-09-01,"Logistics, industrial Reits best-placed to weather economic slowdown: Fitch Ratings",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/property/logistics-industrial-reits-best-placed-weather-economic-slowdown-fitch-ratings,"REAL estate investment trusts (Reits) in the logistics and industrial spaces are the most resilient against rising inflation and interest rates amid an expected economic slowdown in 2023, according to Fitch Ratings.

In a report issued Thursday (Sep 1), the credit ratings agency said logistics Reits such as Mapletree Logistics Trust : M44U 0% (MLT) would continue to benefit from industry tailwinds such as rising e-commerce adoption, the reshoring of supply chains and inventory stockpiling. 

""MLT has a lower exposure to rising electricity costs compared with most rated peers as the tenants bear a large part of the utility costs, while warehouses generally have lower energy usage than most other commercial-property types,"" noted the analysts.
The agency forecast the trust to undertake about S$2 billion worth of acquisitions in FY2023. It is also expected to maintain an occupancy of around 95 per cent in the next 12 to 18 months. 

Analysts of Fitch Ratings said industrial Reits with exposure to high-tech buildings and data centres will be ""somewhat shielded"" against an environment of slowing economic growth, due to their long leases to large corporate tenants. 

""Occupancy and rental reversion for industrial assets leased to SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) tenants will come under pressure from slowing economic growth, but the impact on rated Reits is mitigated by their modest exposure to these properties,"" they stated. 
One such example is Mapletree Industrial Trust : ME8U -0.46% (MIT), as Fitch Ratings expects it to maintain the majority of its exposure to powered-shell assets. According to its analysts, such assets would help to mitigate risks associated with the limited alternative uses of fitted and hyperscale data centres, especially in the event where its tenants could face technology obsolescence over the long term. 

Although MIT's Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) margins are forecast to narrow in FY2023 and FY2024 on rising electricity costs, Fitch Ratings believes the trust will be able to mitigate this impact and maintain a ""solid financial profile"". Its analysts continue to like the trust for its manageable exposure to rising interest rates and limited debt maturities in the next 12 months. 

On the other hand, Fitch Ratings believes hospitality Reits are most at risk to an economic slowdown due to their low rating headroom and still-recovering credit profiles. 

The agency however expects their operating cash flows and balance-sheet buffers to improve in the near term from pent-up travel demand as Singapore continues to reopen progressively. 

It has highlighted Ascott Reit : HMN -1.12%as a potential beneficiary of the anticipated industry recovery given its rapid diversification into longer-stay assets that would boost the trust's cash flow diversity, in Fitch Ratings' view. 

""We believe the Reit's Ebitda interest cover will remain healthy, recovering to about 4 times in 2022 and 4.3 times in 2023 on rising cash flows (compared to 2.8 times in 2021), notwithstanding the rising interest-rate environment,"" said its analysts.

While the agency is projecting a ""sharp recovery"" for retail-focused Reits, it cautioned that those with exposure to prime retail malls - such as Starhill Global Reit : P40U -1.03% - will take longer to reach pre-pandemic earnings than its suburban peers. This comes as the number of visitors from the industry's key inbound market, China, remains low.

Reits whose retail assets are undergoing significant asset enhancement initiatives are also expected to face muted operating cash flow growth in the near term."
2022-09-01,S-Reits in good position to stave off challenges from competing Asian Reit markets,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/s-reits-good-position-stave-challenges-competing-asian-reit,"SINGAPORE'S real estate investment trust (Reit) market is facing increasing competition from up-and-coming counterparts across Asia, where the asset class is gaining popularity among investors.
But market watchers say Singapore-listed Reits (S-Reits) - currently the second largest Reit market in the Asia-Pacific outside Japan - are likely to stave off challenges from the likes of Hong Kong, India, Australia, the Philippines and Thailand.
There are some 43 S-Reits listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX), with a total market value of more than S$111 billion - representing about 12 per cent of Singapore's overall listed stocks.
Speaking at an event organised by the Reit Association of Singapore (Reitas) on Sep 1 (Thursday) to celebrate the 20th anniversary of S-Reits, SGX Group chief executive officer Loh Boon Chye noted that Singapore's Reits industry continues to be one of the fastest-growing in Asia.
""The standing of Singapore as a global Reit hub is well-established and is in a strong position to further innovate and capitalise on trends such as sustainability,"" he said.
""As the ecosystem continues to deepen, we are focused on staying relevant for investors, to meet their demands for diversification and investment returns,"" he added.
Ronald Tan, honorary ex-co member of Reitas and senior vice-president of the equity global market, global sales and origination at SGX, believes it would not be an easy task for other Asian Reit markets to dislodge Singapore from its position as a global Reits hub.

""People take it for granted, now that we have a lot of overseas assets. But when we first tried to introduce this to the market, it took a lot of effort, a lot of learning, a lot of reach-out and education,"" Tan said.

Currently, some 80 per cent of S-Reits and property trusts hold offshore assets across the Asia-Pacific, North America and Europe. ""People think that any platform will be able to do that, but that's not necessarily true,"" he added.

Gail Ong, head of equity capital markets at WongPartnership, said: ""I expect Singapore to remain a popular venue for Reit listings due to the established regulatory framework for Reits, its favourable tax regime, successes experienced by many Reits and investor familiarity with the Singapore Reit market."" The law firm has a strong Reits practice that has handled a number of primary listings and secondary fund-raisings of Reits in Singapore.

At a press conference held in conjunction with the 20th anniversary celebration, Reitas vice-president Jonathan Quek recounted the various phases of growth for S-Reits over the years.

In the beginning were initial public offerings (IPOs) that comprised mainly domestic Singaporean assets. These were followed by predominantly Singapore based S-Reits going overseas and acquiring foreign assets.

More recently, the S-Reit market started seeing the listing of portfolios comprising purely foreign assets. Some of the largest global sponsors also started to list some of their assets here.

In addition, there has been a broadening in terms of sector exposure, with new asset classes such as data centres and student housing coming to the market.

""We do have quite large Reits now in Singapore, when you look at all these combined vehicles. To me, the next phase of growth is whether these Singaporean large Reits will go out into other markets and acquire Reits from other markets,"" said Quek, who is also managing director and co-head of Asean banking, capital markets and advisory at Citigroup Global Markets Singapore.

""The future outlook is bright,"" he added. ""There's been a tremendous amount of resilience that's been built into this market. When you look at performance year to date in these very trying times, across Asia, the Singapore Reit market is probably the second best performing Reit market.""

He ascribed this strength to a diverse investor base for S-Reits.

""You have institutional investors, you have high-net-worth (individuals), you have retail (investors), you have a lot of foreign regional funds that invest in the S-Reit market that typically don't invest in other Reit markets in Asia. So there's a tremendous amount of resilience and diversity, which I think will put the S-Reit market in good stead,"" he said."
2022-09-04,S-Reits with Malaysia assets record stronger operating results,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/s-reits-malaysia-assets-record-stronger-operating-results,"MALAYSIA'S economy recorded stronger GDP growth of 8.9 per cent year on year (yoy) in Q2 2022, following its 5.0 per cent growth in Q1 2022 driven by stronger domestic demand, normalising of economic activity and the reopening of its international borders.

Singapore lists 6 S-Reits with exposure to Malaysia assets - Ascott Residence Trust : HMN -1.12%, Frasers Hospitality Trust : ACV 0%, Keppel DC Reit : AJBU -0.49%, Mapletree Logistics Trust : M44U 0%, ParkwayLife Reit : C2PU -0.27%, and Starhill Global Reit : P40U -1.03%. In addition to these 6, CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U 0% holds an approximate 10.9 per cent stake in Malaysia-listed Sentral Reit (as at Dec 31, 2021).

Starhill Global Reit owns and manages 2 retail properties in its Malaysia portfolio - The Starhill and Lot 10, contributing 14.5 per cent of its total portfolio in terms of asset value (as at Jun 30, 2022). The Reit's net property income (NPI) for H2 FY21/22 grew 7.6 per cent yoy to S$75.1 million largely due to the cessation of rental rebates in Malaysia following the completion of asset enhancement works at The Starhill, as well as lower expenses for the group. NPI for its Malaysia properties rose 70.1 per cent yoy in H2 FY21/22, bringing its overall FY21/FY22 growth for the segment to 43.8 per cent.
Asset enhancement works for The Starhill was completed in December 2021 and the mall attracted new tenants like The Chamber's flagship store which has the widest liquor collection in the country, Eslite Spectrum a renowned Taiwanese bookstore with the first flagship store in South-east Asia opening in end 2022, and other luxury flagship stores including Tom Ford, Roberto Coin, Paul & Shark, and Balmain. The Reit's Lot 10 continued to attract new tenants including Genki Sushi, 32 Parfait and The Soybean Factory.

According to Retail Group Malaysia (RGM), Malaysia retail sales rose 62.5 per cent yoy to new record levels in Q2 2022, following an 18.3 per cent yoy growth seen in Q1 2022. Growth was largely contributed by the Hari Raya festival and the relaxation of Covid-19 measures, which saw all retail sub-sectors achieve positive growth rates in Q2 2022, surpassing market expectations. Retail associations, Malaysia Retailers Association and Malaysia Retail Chain Association, are expecting an average growth rate of 61.7 per cent in retail sales for Q3 2022.
Mapletree Logistics Trust (MLT) has 4.9 per cent of its assets under management in 16 logistics properties in Malaysia (as at Jun 30, 2022). MLT reported 13.2 per cent yoy growth in NPI and 17.2 per cent yoy growth in amount distributable to unitholders. Distribution per unit (DPU) to unitholders rose 5.0 per cent to 2.268 Singapore cents, citing steady growth in operating results underpinned by stable occupancy and contributions from an enlarged portfolio.

Active asset enhancement to unlock value is a key management strategy and MLT is exploring the potential amalgamation of Subang 3 and 4 in Malaysia with the 2 land parcels acquired recently. Redevelopment costs are expected to be around S$173 million with a project completion target in 2027.
Frasers Hospitality Trust has The Westin Kuala Lumpur (TWKL) in its Malaysia portfolio, contributing 5.0 per cent in total gross revenue (as at Mar 31, 2022). In its latest business updates for Q3 FY22, TWKL recorded a strong rebound in occupancy to 36.0 per cent from both corporate and leisure demand, and revenue per available room almost doubling yoy in 9MFY22 due to improved average daily rate and occupancy."
2022-09-07,FHT privatisation offers value for FHT’s securities holders but not shareholders of Frasers Property,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/fht-privatisation-offers-value-fhts-securities-holders-not-shareholders,"INVESTORS looking for plays on international travel may soon find themselves with one fewer option on the Singapore Exchange.

On Sep 12, stapled securities holders of Frasers Hospitality Trust : ACV 0% (FHT) will meet at an extraordinary general meeting to decide whether to approve the proposed privatisation of FHT via a scheme of arrangement.
The deal is a good one for FHT unitholders as the offeror, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Frasers Property Limited : TQ5 +0.61% (FPL), is paying more than book value. FHT unitholders will receive S$0.70 in cash for each FHT stapled security that FPL and TCC Group Investments do not already hold.
FHT is smaller in scale relative to its peers - ranked 32nd by free float market capitalisation among real estate investment trusts (Reits) and business trusts as at Apr 7 - in a market where size is essential to liquidity and substantive growth. Over the 3-year period to Apr 7, FHT traded at a discount to net asset value (NAV) of 25 per cent.

The scheme consideration represents a premium of 43.8 per cent over the 12-month volume-weighted average price per stapled security up to and including Apr 7, the last full trading day prior to FHT's announcement of its strategic review. It also implies a price-to-adjusted NAV as at end-May of nearly 1.1 times. The said NAV captures latest independent valuations, which have taken into account the possible recovery of the trust's properties from Covid-19.

Based on end-June valuations and prices as at Sep 6, 2022, FHT's peers with larger total assets, namely CDL Hospitality Trusts : J85 -0.98% and Far East Hospitality Trust : Q5T -0.84%, traded at a discount to NAV of 2.3 per cent and 27.4 per cent, respectively.
FHT owns 14 assets, comprising hotels and serviced residences across Singapore, the United Kingdom, Australia, Malaysia, Germany and Japan. Hospitality is a core business of FPL, and the FHT deal allows FPL to up its investment in locations it is already familiar with.

But FPL is spending over half a billion Singapore dollars to raise its FHT stake from 25.8 per cent to 63.3 per cent.

With rising interest rates and mounting economic risks, should FPL, which had net-debt-to-equity of 70.5 per cent as at end-June, conserve its cash instead? Should it be paying above book value for additional exposure to FHT's portfolio?

The hospitality sector faces headwinds, and sector growth has been minimal in FHT's operational markets since the trust's IPO. The financial performance and valuations of the FHT properties in local currency terms may be hit if the Singapore dollar strengthens against currencies such as the British pound, Australian dollar, euro, Malaysian ringgit and Japanese yen.

The timing and speed of a full recovery of FHT's assets from the impact of Covid-19 are uncertain. Also, ongoing geopolitical tensions and inflationary pressures could lead to a fall in consumer spending on discretionary goods and services, while rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital.

Moreover, FPL may be an inefficient vehicle to hold completed hospitality properties. The market has already substantially marked down the value of FPL's assets: FPL trades at slightly over 0.4 times its end-March NAV, based on its share price of S$1.07 as at Sep 6, 2022.

Perhaps, FPL should deploy its funds elsewhere. The industrial and logistics property business, which benefits from the expansion of e-commerce, may have greater potential.

FPL first ventured into this sector in 2014. As at end-March, the logistics and industrial segment accounted for 32 per cent of FPL's total property assets of S$34.3 billion. The hospitality segment made up 14 per cent.

FHT's independent directors are to be lauded for addressing the market's underpricing of the trust. FPL's board should learn from FHT's board and work on ways to bridge the gap between its share price and its NAV.

FPL could go private, as suggested by my colleague Ben Paul in a commentary dated Aug 29. FPL chairman Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi and his spouse, Khunying Wanna Sirivadhanabhakdi, hold a deemed interest of around 87 per cent in FPL. If chairman Charoen and his family plan to privatise FPL, they can refer to the FHT scheme and make an offer at above book value.

Another way for FPL to unlock value could involve privatising the development business, injecting hospitality assets into a private fund, and keeping investment properties and Reit management in a listed vehicle.

FPL has helped to raise the bar for how sponsor groups can reposition a failing Reit. Next up, FPL can show family-owned property groups how to restructure to optimise value for all shareholders."
2022-09-11,Five S-Reits with the lowest gearing ratios,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/five-s-reits-lowest-gearing-ratios,"ON average, S-Reits have maintained an average gearing ratio of 36.8 per cent, based on latest company filings which were extracted in mid-August 2022. The 5 S-Reits with the lowest gearing ratios reported are Digital Core Reit, Sasseur Reit, Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust, SPH Reit, and IReit Global.

Based on the sector's average gearing ratio of 36.8 per cent and regulatory limit of 50 per cent, this translates into approximately S$22.6 billion (based on Bloomberg data for total assets multiplied by company-reported gearing ratio) of potential debt headroom for the sector, to fund capital-intensive acquisitions.
Digital Core Reit reported 25.7 per cent aggregated leverage as of Jun 30, 2022 and estimates a debt headroom of US$194 million at 35 per cent aggregated leverage. The Reit expects to make its first distribution of 2.37 US cents to unitholders on Sep 28 and is prepared to embark on its maiden acquisition of data centres in Frankfurt, Dallas, and Chicago. The acquisition is expected to be DPU-accretive and may be funded with debt. An EGM is expected to be scheduled in the third quarter.
Sasseur Reit has consistently maintained one of lowest gearing ratios among S-Reits at 26.5 per cent aggregated leverage as of Jun 30, 2022 and estimates a debt headroom of S$904.7 million based on the regulatory limit of 50 per cent. With onshore and offshore debts of approximately S$510.9 million maturing in March 2023, the Reit aims to complete its debt refinancing exercise by end 2022.
Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust reported aggregate leverage of 29.2 per cent as of Jun 30, 2022, down 3.9 percentage points from a quarter ago. Based on the regulatory limit of 50 per cent, the Reit has an estimated debt headroom of S$2,877 million. The Reit's logistics and industrial portfolio maintained full occupancy with no expiries in Q4FY22 while the commercial portfolio reported occupancy rate of 91.3 per cent. The Reit expects the overall operating environment to further improve with strong tenant activity observed, as countries progressively return to normalcy.
SPH Reit reported 30.1 per cent gearing as of May 31, 2022 and updated that this provides debt headroom flexibility with access to additional liquidity from S$225 million of undrawn revolving credit facility lines. The Reit maintained a high occupancy rate of 97.6 per cent. The Reit's year-to-date Q3 gross revenue registered an increase of 0.9 per cent year on year to S$211.6 million and declared Q3FY22 DPU of 1.45 cents, increasing 5.1 per cent year on year.
IReit Global's aggregate leverage improved from 32.1 per cent as of Dec 31, 2021 to 30.8 per cent as of Jun 30, 2022. This was mainly driven by the 6-year lease extension for 100 per cent of Bonn Campus and a 12-year major new lease for approximately 5,300 sqm data centre space at Sant Cugat Green in Q2 2022. This in turn contributed to the increase in the Reit's portfolio valuation to surpass the 1.0 billion euro mark.
Gearing ratio, also known as aggregated leverage, is the ratio of a Reit's total debt to its total assets. This is a metric closely monitored by investors and is often used to assess a Reit's financial leverage.

A lower gearing ratio could point to greater capacity to undertake more debt when needed for future acquisitions while a higher gearing ratio could lead to credit concerns, especially during economic downturns.

S-Reits have a regulatory leverage limit of 50 per cent, imposed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). This limit was increased from 45 per cent in April 2020, to provide S-Reits with more flexibility to manage their capital structure amid the challenging environment from the Covid-19 pandemic."
2022-09-12,Frasers Hospitality Trust privatisation bid falls shy of required 75% approval in scheme meeting,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/frasers-hospitality-trust-privatisation-bid-falls-shy-required-75-approval-scheme,"THE bid by the managers of Frasers Hospitality Trust (FHT) to go private has been scuttled, after the Singapore-listed real estate investment trust (S-Reit) failed to garner the mandatory approvals from stapled securityholders at a scheme meeting on Monday (Sep 12).

Some 70.91 per cent of stapled securityholders representing 74.88 per cent of units voted in favour of the proposed scheme.

Of the 227.6 million stapled securities represented by votes, 170.4 million voted to approve the scheme while the remaining 57.2 million voted against.
For the scheme to be passed, the resolution had to be approved by a majority in the number of stapled securityholders representing at least 75 per cent of the total number of units held by those present and voting by proxy.

Various parties including the offeror - a wholly-owned subsidiary of real estate giant Frasers Property Limited (FPL), the sponsor of FHT - and its concert parties, substantial stapled securityholders of FHT and the managers of FHT abstained from voting on the scheme.

""They were defeated by a narrow margin,"" FHT stapled securityholder Mano Sabnani told The Business Times (BT). ""They fell short of the 75 per cent rule.""
Sabnani, who has been a stapled securityholder of the hospitality-focused S-Reit since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2014, added that the vote came after a ""lively discussion"" at the scheme meeting.

According to him, the arguments that the managers of FHT had used to justify the privatisation - such as its small size and obstacles in growing distribution per stapled security (DPS) and net asset value (NAV) - were factors that were known since its IPO.

""The arguments are just changed when it suits them. They turn all the arguments on the head and put them across,"" Sabnani said. ""I was against the (proposed privatisation) from the start.""

The managers of FHT on Jun 13 announced the proposed privatisation, which would see FPL pay S$0.70 in cash for each FHT stapled security that FPL and TCC Group Investments do not already hold.

The move came after FHT in April announced a strategic review to explore various options to ""enhance and unlock value"" for stapled securityholders.

The scheme consideration price represented a premium of 7 per cent to FHT's NAV at the time of the announcement.

Since its IPO, it had traded at an average discount of 19 per cent to its NAV. Over the 3-year period to Apr 7 - the day before it announced its strategic review - the Reit traded at a discount to NAV of 25 per cent.

However, the way minority shareholders such as Sabnani see it, the proposed buyout was ""opportunistic"".

While the managers of FHT said they had explored other options, including a merger with other trusts, and the sale of its individual assets or the FHT platform to a third party, Sabnani said it seemed ""incredulous"" that no one offered a better price than the sponsor, given the current market situation.

""The bottom line is still that it is an opportunistic buyout at a low point, when we are at the cusp of a recovery,"" Sabnani said. ""The (hospitality) industry is in a major recovery.""

He added that the proposed privatisation would likely have been approved by stapled securityholders if the offeror had dangled a higher offer price which would be perceived by minority shareholders to be closer to fair value.

In response to queries from BT, the managers of FHT said it would respect the decision of stapled securityholders and the outcome of the meeting.

""While we believe that the privatisation has its merits, stapled securityholders have expressed their preference for FHT to remain listed and we are heartened by their support and confidence for FHT,"" said Eu Chin Fen, chief executive officer of the managers of FHT.
""We shall remain focused to ride on the gradual recovery trajectory and navigate through the challenges and opportunities ahead of us. We continue to stay committed to create and deliver long-term value to our stapled securityholders,"" she added.
""We remain committed as the sponsor of FHT and will continue to support FHT in its strategic initiatives,"" said a spokesperson of sponsor FPL."
2022-09-14,Ascendas Reit to buy cold storage logistics facility in Singapore for S$191.9m,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/ascendas-reit-buy-cold-storage-logistics-facility-singapore-s1919m,"THE manager of Ascendas Real Estate Investment Trust : A17U 0% (Ascendas Reit) has proposed to acquire a cold storage logistics facility for S$191.9 million, it said on Wednesday (Sep 14).

The property, which is located at 1 Buroh Lane, is the real estate investment trust's (Reit) first cold storage facility investment in Singapore, said William Tay, chief executive of the manager, in a press statement.

Assuming the proposed transaction was completed on Jan 1, 2021, the manager expects a distribution per unit accretion of 0.56 per cent or an improvement of 0.086 Singapore cent on a pro forma basis.
The 5-storey ramp-up logistics distribution centre was built around 7 years ago. It has a gross floor area of around 59,971 square metres and includes a chiller, freezer, air-conditioned and ambient storage space, as well as ancillary office space. It is within the Jalan Buroh Food Zone where over 30 licensed food establishments reside. 

It is also fully occupied by 5 ""well-established"" tenants, including a supermarket chain and distributors of fruits and vegetables, the manager noted. Furthermore, it has a weighted average lease expiry of 7 years and built-in rent escalations of 2-3 per cent every 3 years.

For the first year post-acquisition, the manager is estimating a net property income yield of around 7 per cent for pre-transaction costs and 6.9 per cent for post-transaction costs. 
The S$191.9 million purchase consideration is at a slight discount to the property's independent market valuation of S$195 million as at May 10. The total cost of acquisition is S$196.2 million, comprising the purchase consideration, a S$1.9 million acquisition fee payable to the manager, and S$2.4 million in other fees and expenses.

The Reit will fund the proposed deal through internal resources and/or existing debt facilities, and expects to complete the transaction in Q4 2022. 

The counter closed flat at S$2.90 on Tuesday."
2022-09-14,"Brokers’ take: DBS calls MPACT’s valuations attractive, reinstates coverage with ‘buy’",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/brokers-take-dbs-calls-mpacts-valuations-attractive-reinstates,"DBS Group Research on Wednesday (Sep 14) called Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust : N2IU +0.74% (MPACT) an ""opportunity not to be missed"" as it expects the real estate investment trust (Reit) to be a beneficiary of further recovery when Hong Kong and China reopen.

The Asia-focused Reit is trading at a yield above 5 per cent, offering an attractive yield spread as the third-largest Singapore-listed Reit (S-Reit), DBS said in a report.

It has reinstated its coverage on the counter with a ""buy"" call and target price of S$2.30, implying a potential upside of 20.4 per cent on MPACT's last trading price of S$1.91 as at 4.08 pm on Wednesday. Its units were trading 1 per cent or S$0.02 lower at the time. 
MPACT is currently trading at 1 time its net asset value, slightly above the mean of the weighted average historical trading range of Mapletree Commercial Trust (MCT) and Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust (MNACT).

MCT and MNACT merged to form MPACT in August by way of a trust scheme. MNACT was later delisted from the Singapore Exchange.

The potential divestment of non-core assets in Japan and China could allow the Reit to review and optimise its portfolio. This means MPACT will be able to focus on good-quality assets in its core market - Singapore, raising its net property income contributions in the process.
Its retail assets VivoCity and Festival Walk will likely benefit from further recovery when Hong Kong and China reopen further. The Reit could even deliver a 2-year distribution per unit compound annual growth rate of 7 per cent, assuming a full recovery for both assets and other assets remain stable."
2022-09-15,FHT’s failed privatisation not a complete surprise as unitholders bet on tourism recovery,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/fhts-failed-privatisation-not-complete-surprise-unitholders-bet-tourism,"THE failed attempt by Frasers Hospitality Trust (FHT) to go private came as a surprise to some market observers.

Opposition to the cash offering of S$0.70 per stapled security - at a 7 per cent premium to net asset value (NAV) - by sponsor Frasers Property (FPL) was generally muted.

After all, the privatisation offer seemed generous enough - given the hospitality-focused real estate investment trust (Reit) had traded at an average discount of 19 per cent to its NAV since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2014.
From the viewpoint of minority unitholders, however, the offer was beginning to make less sense.

For one, the proposed privatisation, announced mid-June, comes amid a resurgence in the hospitality sector with the relaxation of Covid-19 curbs and the reopening of borders.

Hospitality Reits listed in Singapore have seen a remarkable revival in fortunes.
The 4 hospitality Reits with Singapore assets - Ascott Residence Trust (ART), CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT), Far East Hospitality Trust (FEHT) and FHT - form the only Reit sub-sector to achieve positive returns this year.

The hospitality Reits, excluding the US-based hospitality segment, managed average returns of 16.9 per cent in the year to end-August, according to data from Bloomberg and DBS.

In comparison, the FTSE ST Real Estate Investment Trusts Index has returned -6.8 per cent over the same period while the benchmark Straits Times Index returned 3.1 per cent.

The strength of the hospitality Reit subsector can mostly be chalked up to optimism over the reopening theme.

All 4 Reits saw a significant uplift in prices around March, as Singapore announced the easing of community safe-management measures and border curbs.

FHT received a further boost on news of its strategic review in April and the proposed privatisation announced in June, which lifted the price of its stapled securities to around the offer price of S$0.70.

But with the hospitality sector on the cusp of a major recovery, after over 2 years in the doldrums due to the pandemic, FHT's stapled securityholders cannot be faulted for perceiving the privatisation offer to be ""opportunistic"", as one described it.

After all, data from the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) pointed to a sixth straight month of growth in average room rates (ARR) at Singapore hotels in July, as pent-up demand drove rates to the highest level in almost a decade.

Latest STB data released Sep 14 also showed Singapore's international visitor arrivals grew for the 7th straight month in August.

And while the offer was at a premium to NAV, longtime investors in the Reit rued that it was at a 20 per cent discount to FHT's IPO price of S$0.88.

Minority unitholders may also have felt that the Reit had not yet lived up to its promise.

For example, in its IPO prospectus, the managers of FHT touted the merits of its 12-property initial portfolio with a total value of S$1.66 billion.

Another 18 properties were in the pipeline, for which FHT had been granted a right of first refusal by its sponsor, that would more than double its room count.

As at Sep 30, 2021, FHT's portfolio comprised just 15 properties - 10 of which are from the initial portfolio - with a total value of about S$2.25 billion.

Ultimately, the privatisation bid failed to garner the required 75 per cent of votes to go through - albeit missing by just a whisker of 0.12 per cent.

Following the failed privatisation attempt, stapled securities of FHT have fallen nearly 24 per cent to S$0.535 on Sep 14 - below the price before it announced the strategic review.

While the privatisation by the sponsor is now off the table, FHT still has some cards it could play.

It could consider the sale of some individual assets that are underperforming or have less growth potential, as it rejuvenates its portfolio with the injection of pipeline assets from its sponsor.

This could be an opportune time for strategic divestments, with Singapore hotel prices hitting new highs on the back of the hospitality revival.

The divestment gains could be returned to unitholders, which might make some happy.

FHT could also explore the acquisition of or merger with another hospitality Reit listed in Singapore, or the sale of the entire FHT platform to a third party at a higher price.

With the managers of FHT having been so forthcoming in talking down the Reit's prospects as they sought support for the proposed privatisation, however, it could be difficult now to find an interested buyer.

The real surprise should be how a Reit backed by such a strong sponsor could have found itself in such a situation."
2022-09-18,Logistics S-Reits to ride on e-commerce growth,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/logistics-s-reits-ride-e-commerce-growth,"WITH accelerated digital transformation, shifts in consumer trends and a greater focus on supply-chain resilience, the global logistics industry remains central to the rapid growth of e-commerce. According to Cushman & Wakefield, global industrial/logistics Reits recorded the highest 10-year annualised total returns of any asset class, at 16.4 per cent last year, buoyed by the unprecedented growth in e-commerce.

Reits with logistics properties are typically labelled as industrial Reits. There are 11 listed S-Reits and Property Trusts with exposure to logistics properties. These trusts have assets located globally in major cities including Singapore, China, Japan, India, Australia, the UK and the US.

The 11 trusts, which underperformed the broader iEdge S-Reit Index in the year-to-date, saw stronger rebounds in the 3Q-to-date. They averaged 3Q-to-date total returns of 4 per cent, compared to the iEdge S-Reit Index's 1 per cent total returns. On a longer term basis, the 11 trusts generated average 10-year total returns of 90 per cent, outpacing the iEdge S-Reit Index's 69 per cent total returns.
Ascendas Reit : A17U 0% (AReit) has a portfolio value of S$16.6 billion, consisting of 25 per cent in logistics assets. Last week, the Reit proposed to acquire a cold storage logistics facility in Singapore for S$191.9 million. It will be the Reit's first cold storage facility investment in Singapore. As at Jun 30, 2022, the property is fully occupied by five well-established tenants including a supermarket chain and leading distributors of fruits and vegetables. With a weighted average lease expiry of 7 years and built-in rent escalations of 2 per cent to 3 per cent every 3 years, the Reit expects the acquisition to expand its customer base and strengthen its income stability.
MLT expects that the acceleration of e-commerce will continue to drive demand growth for logistics space, particularly modern logistics properties in prime locations. It notes that Covid-19 has further underscored the importance of building supply chain diversification and resiliency. Hence, it believes that with MLT's extensive network of strategically located assets across Asia-Pacific, it is well-positioned to meet the growing needs of global and regional supply chain players.
This comes after AReit completed the acquisition of 7 logistics properties in Chicago in the US, for a total purchase consideration of S$133.2 million in 2Q2022. With plans to diversify its exposure in the US, AReit acquired a total of 18 last-mile logistics properties in the last 12 months across Kansas City and Chicago. Its US logistics portfolio was worth S$2.5 billion as at Jun 30, 2022, and comprises business spaces and logistics properties.
Mapletree Logistics Trust : M44U 0% (MLT) is focused on logistics assets in the Asia-Pacific. As of Jun 30, 2022, it has a portfolio of 185 properties in Singapore, Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea and Vietnam with assets under management of S$13 billion."

At over S$900 million, S-Reit ETFs represent more than half the S$1.7 billion combined AUM of Reit ETFs in Asia-Pacific ex-Japan globally.

The 5 Reit ETFs listed in Singapore (in order of AUM size) are NikkoAM-StraitsTrading Asia Ex Japan Reit ETF, Lion-Phillip S-Reit ETF, UOB Asia-Pacific Green Reit ETF, CSOP iEdge S-Reit Leaders ETF, and Phillip SGX APAC Dividend Leaders Reit ETF.

Retail investors have been a key driver in the locally-listed Reit ETFs for the past year, accounting for 44 per cent of Reit ETF holdings. Institutional investors make up the other 56 per cent of Reit ETF holdings. Retail investors bought over S$1 billion worth of S-Reits in 2021 and continued to deploy funds into the sector, with net inflows exceeding S$930 million in mid-September 2022. Net buy/sell amount is derived by subtracting total sell amount from total buy amount.
Despite generating average total returns of -6.8 per cent in the first 8 months of 2022, the 5 Reit ETFs recorded net inflows of S$163 million in the year to date thus far. The Lion-Phillip S-Reit ETF has been the best performer over the first 8 months of 2022 with total returns of -3.53 per cent and has the highest dividend yield of 5.04 per cent. During the same period, the FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index (a benchmark for global Reits) posted a price decline of 18.5 per cent.

After Lion-Phillip S-Reit ETF, the CSOP iEdge S-Reit Leaders ETF was the second-highest yielding Reit ETF with a dividend yield of 4.97 per cent, followed by the NikkoAM-StraitsTrading Asia Ex Japan Reit ETF at 4.92 per cent.
The NikkoAM-StraitsTrading Asia ex-Japan Reit ETF and Lion-Phillip S-Reit ETF are among the top 10 ETFs listed on SGX by trading turnover and by net inflows.
Reit ETFs provide investors instant diversification across various sub-sectors and geographical regions at lower execution costs as opposed to building a similar portfolio through investing in individual Reits. Aside from direct cash investments, retail investors may also invest in Singapore-listed Reit ETFs via the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) and the CPF investment scheme (CPFIS)."
2022-10-02,5 S-Reits with net institutional and retail inflows in Q3 2022,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/5-s-reits-net-institutional-and-retail-inflows-q3-2022,"THE global Reits sector was among the least performing sectors in the third quarter of 2022, amid a rising interest rates environment. For the quarter, Singapore's Reits and Property Trusts (S-Reits) sector declined 7 per cent in total returns, slightly outperforming the 10 per cent decline of the broader FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index.

Across the sub-sectors, industrial S-Reits saw the least declines, averaging -3 per cent total returns during the quarter, while office S-Reits saw the most declines, averaging -16 per cent total returns.

In terms of net fund flows, the S-Reit sector saw S$360 million of net institutional outflows but received S$504 million of net retail inflows.
There were five S-Reits that received net inflows from both institutional and retail investors. They are CapitaLand Ascendas Reit : A17U 0%, Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust : N2IU +0.74%, Mapletree Logistics Trust : M44U 0%, Lendlease Global Commercial Reit : JYEU +0.98% and Digital Core Reit : DCRU +0.99%.

CapitaLand Ascendas Reit (CLAR), which was recently renamed from Ascendas Reit, received net inflows of S$25 million and S$8 million from institutional and retail investors respectively.

The Reit noted that while supply chain disruptions, inflation and rising interest rates could have some impact on tenants' businesses as well as on CLAR's operating costs, it is optimistic that structural trends such as expansion of logistics capacities by companies and digitalisation of the economy could drive demand for CLAR's logistics and data centre segments.
Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust (MPACT) received net inflows of S$20 million from institutional investors and S$14 million from retail investors. The Reit is scheduled to announce its first post-merger financial results for H1 2022/2023 on Oct 27, 2022.

Mapletree Logistics Trust (MLT) received net inflows of S$9 million and S$39 million from institutional and retail investors respectively. MLT observed that while the global economic environment remains highly uncertain, overall leasing demand for warehouse space has stayed resilient, supported by domestic consumption, e-commerce and inventory stockpiling.

Lendlease Global Commercial Reit (LReit) received net inflows of S$1 million and S$4 million from institutional and retail investors respectively.

At the end of August, the Reit announced that it has achieved its net-zero carbon target ahead of its original target and was accomplished through various carbon reduction strategies within its Singapore assets.

LReit expects that this will generate net interest savings to its unitholders as the Reit meets sustainability performance targets under its S$960 million of sustainability-linked loans and S$216 million of sustainability-linked derivatives.
Digital Core Reit received net inflows of S$0.2 million from institutional investors and S$2 million from retail investors. The Reit announced its inaugural acquisition since IPO on Sep 22, 2022. The acquisitions will consist of a 25 per cent interest in an institutional quality freehold data centre in Frankfurt, Germany, valued at 558 million euros, and a 90 per cent interest in an institutional quality freehold data centre in Dallas, Texas, valued at US$199 million."
2022-10-03,"Amid rising rates, tight borrowing limits a blessing for Reits, homebuyers",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/amid-rising-rates-tight-borrowing-limits-blessing-reits-homebuyers,"WHEN cost of debt is low, loading up on debt to buy a property is compelling.

For a property with an annual entry yield of 3 per cent, the yield on equity rises to 3.4 per cent and 4.5 per cent based on funding the purchase 30 per cent and 60 per cent by debt respectively, assuming cost of debt of 2 per cent per annum.

If the cost of debt is 3.5 per cent per annum, the yield on equity in the above example falls to 2.8 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively.
The simulation shows that using debt to fund a property purchase is much less compelling when interest rates rise. The three-month compounded Singapore Overnight Rate Average (Sora) was around 0.2 per cent or less per annum for much of mid-2020 through early 2021. As at value date Sep 30, 2022, the three-month Sora was 2.07 per cent per annum.

Property owners such as real estate investment trusts (Reits) and individuals are grappling with rising debt costs. In such a climate, managers of Reits and homeowners may be happy not to be overly leveraged due to regulatory limits.
For Reits, the total borrowings and deferred payments should not exceed 45 per cent of the fund's deposited property. A property fund's aggregate leverage may exceed 45 per cent of the fund's deposited property, up to a maximum of 50 per cent, only if the fund has a minimum adjusted interest coverage ratio of 2.5 times after taking into account the interest payment obligations arising from the new borrowings.
For Reits, the total borrowings and deferred payments should not exceed 45 per cent of the fund's deposited property. A property fund's aggregate leverage may exceed 45 per cent of the fund's deposited property, up to a maximum of 50 per cent, only if the fund has a minimum adjusted interest coverage ratio of 2.5 times after taking into account the interest payment obligations arising from the new borrowings.


The loan-to-value (LTV) that limits what an individual can borrow from a financial institution for a housing loan is 75 per cent for those with no outstanding housing loan, and 45 per cent and 35 per cent for those with one outstanding housing loan and two or more outstanding housing loans respectively. Lower LTV limits apply if the loan tenure exceeds 30 years (or 25 years for HDB flats), or the loan period extends beyond the borrower's age of 65 years. Separately, the LTV limit for HDB housing loans is 80 per cent.

Another regulation governing extension of credit by financial institutions caps the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR), which refers to the portion of a borrower's gross monthly income that goes towards repaying the monthly debt obligations, including the loan being applied for, at 55 per cent.

Also, buyers of HDB flats and executive condominium (EC) units, where the EC's minimum occupancy period has not expired, are subject to a mortgage servicing ratio (MSR) cap of 30 per cent on the gross monthly income that goes towards repaying all property loans, including the loan being applied for.

Effective Sep 30, 2022, a 0.5 percentage point higher medium-term interest rate floor is used to compute the TDSR and MSR. A floor of 4 per cent per annum is now used to compute TDSR and MSR for home loans. Separately, for HDB flats buyers, an interest rate floor of 3 per cent per annum is now used to compute the eligible loan amount available to borrowers seeking HDB loans.

Flexibility

Applying strict limits on what a Reit or homeowner can borrow has downsides.

A Reit manager may like to push the amount of borrowing beyond the regulatory limit temporarily due to a timing difference between the completion of a new property purchase and the sale of an existing property.

Also, a Reit manager may want to push the debt level up temporarily as more borrowing is incurred to fund capital expenditure on asset enhancement work, which can result in higher asset valuation.

At times, the ability of Reits to grow via acquisitions is hampered as the trusts cannot compete with asset buyers who are able to gear up more.

For homebuyers, having more generous LTV, TDSR and MSR limits can help less cash-rich buyers. Tough borrowing limits could disadvantage a young homebuyer who needs to rely on using credit, versus a peer who can get financial support from parents.

An individual with strong earnings prospects may want to take on a large home loan because he expects to make a partial capital repayment in a few years' time.

Also, banks may want to lend to some individuals who have high debt liabilities because such a situation is temporary, or the said borrowers have minimal other expenditure.

But events such as the outbreak of the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine remind us that the world is an uncertain place.

Individuals may see their ability to repay loans change dramatically due to a job loss. A Reit manager, who is expecting to receive cash proceeds from an asset sale, may see cash flow projections messed up should such a sale fall through.

It can be tricky setting the level of a property fund's aggregate leverage limit, or the LTV, TDSR and MSR limits applicable to homebuyers.

Even as interest rates rise, debt has a useful role to play in funding purchases of chunky physical properties, which can generate recurring income and capital gains.

Robust markets

Nonetheless, the Reit and homes markets are more robust due to tight borrowing limits.

The risk to the banking system from overly leveraged homebuyers defaulting on mortgage payments, which can be catastrophic, is mitigated.

Many individuals invest in Reits to earn passive income to help fund retirement needs. The success of the Reit market and value of retirement investment portfolios can be jeopardised should overly-leveraged Reits face refinancing difficulties.

Being clever with using debt in buying property helps. Some Reits can better deal with rising interest rates because they have locked in borrowings with longer durations, spread out debt maturities and have a higher proportion of fixed rate debt.

Some homeowners may have locked in fixed rate home loans some time back, albeit these owners could face higher mortgage bills as fixed rate periods of say two or three years expire.

Individuals and businesses are seeing costs of goods and services increase. The goods and services tax will go up from 2023. Businesses and individuals need to be vigilant on costs, including rising debt cost.

The Singapore Reit and residential property markets can face rising interest rates and slowing economic growth with some confidence, because of prudent levels of borrowings."
2022-10-05,"S-Reit acquisitions up in September, but smaller deals signal weakening appetite amid uncertainty",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/s-reit-acquisitions-september-smaller-deals-signal-weakening-appetite-amid,"DESPITE concerns over rising interest rates and a global economic slowdown, September has emerged as the most active month this year for acquisitions by Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits).

Seven proposed acquisitions were announced in September, adding to the 19 announced in the first eight months of the year.

This brings the total number of proposed acquisitions in the year to date to 26 - or around half the 50-odd asset acquisitions announced in 2021.
The recent acquisitions are smaller, reflecting perhaps a more cautious stance among managers.

The manager of Frasers Centrepoint Trust (FCT) : J69U +1.46% announced on Sep 12 it would acquire a further 10 per cent stake in Waterway Point for S$132.3 million. This will bring FCT's interest in the Punggol shopping mall to 50 per cent.

Hot on the heels of this announcement, the manager of Parkway Life Real Estate Investment Trust (PLife Reit) : C2PU -0.27% said it is acquiring three nursing homes in Japan's Hokkaido region for 2.56 billion yen (S$26.1 million).
PLife Reit later in the month announced the proposed acquisition of another two nursing homes in Japan - this time in the Greater Tokyo region - for 2.88 billion yen.

Another healthcare S-Reit, First Real Estate Investment Trust (First Reit) : AW9U +2.17%, also announced the acquisition of two nursing homes in Japan for 2.6 billion yen.

Meanwhile, the manager of industrial real estate investment trust (Reit) CapitaLand Ascendas Reit (Clar) : A17U 0%, formerly known as Ascendas Reit, proposed the acquisition of a cold storage logistics facility in Singapore for S$191.9 million.

September also saw the pair of newest S-Reit listings - Daiwa House Logistics Trust (DHLT) : DHLU -0.91% and Digital Core Reit : DCRU +0.99%, both of which started trading on the Singapore Exchange late last year - make their maiden acquisitions.

The manager of DHLT announced the proposed acquisition of two freehold logistics facilities and a piece of freehold land in Japan from its sponsor for 4.68 billion yen.

Digital Core Reit entered into an agreement with its sponsor to acquire a 25 per cent interest in a data centre in Frankfurt, Germany.

The manager of the pure-play data centre Reit said it also has the option to acquire up to an 89.9 per cent interest in the Frankfurt facility, as well as a 90 per cent interest in a data centre in Dallas, Texas.

While the large number of proposed asset acquisitions in September is an encouraging sign for the S-Reit market, it is clear that appetites are changing due to the uncertain economic climate.

For one, the deals are markedly smaller. Over half the acquisitions proposed last month came in at under S$50 million.

RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan said market acquisitions are likely to be ""more piecemeal in nature"" due to the current volatility.

""(The acquisition of a larger portfolio) involves an extended time frame and premium valuations, which are unfavourable in current market conditions,"" Natarajan said.

A few of the deals proposed in September, such as those by the managers of FCT and Clar, were valued at above S$100 million. But these amounts remain small relative to the size of the Reits.

The smaller acquisitions, though, should not come as a surprise.

William Tay, chief executive officer of Clar's manager, guided at a briefing in August accompanying the industrial Reit's first-half results release that it was ""unlikely"" to hit S$1 billion worth of acquisitions this year.

""We are still in the market looking for inorganic growth, but it is likely to be in smaller chunks,"" Tay said.

Notably, the unsavoury conditions for larger acquisitions have also driven Clar to other avenues in search of growth.

Clar on Sep 30 announced it has signed a lease agreement that will see it convert an existing office asset into a life sciences property at an estimated cost of US$40 million.

Following the completion of the convert-to-suit exercise in the fourth quarter of 2023, the manager said Clar is expected to receive a higher base rent with an annual escalation of 3 per cent. . The net property income yield of the asset will also be raised to 9 per cent.

Meanwhile, the other deal that was valued at over S$100 million in September - that involving Digital Core Reit - comes with options.

Digital Core Reit will only take up the option to buy the enlarged stake in the Frankfurt facility as well as the 90 per cent stake in the Dallas facility if it is able to raise money by issuing new units.

The manager of Digital Core Reit said it preferred the larger-sized deal, which would be 3.1 per cent accretive to distribution per unit (DPU) on a pro forma basis.

Amid the uncertain climate, however, management is aware that unitholders will be wary of stumping up more cash. The counter is also down nearly 40 per cent this year, which makes a new issue less attractive.

""If we're able to raise equity at an attractive valuation, then I think the bigger deal does a lot for us,"" said John Stewart, chief executive of Digital Core Reit's manager. ""Quite frankly, our preference would be the bigger deal… (But only) if we can do it in a manner that doesn't dilute unitholders by forcing us to issue equity at a discount.""

Should the Reit manager decide not to proceed with the equity fundraising option at this time, Digital Core Reit will settle for the smaller deal in a fully debt-funded transaction. This will be 2 per cent accretive to pro forma DPU. In this debt-funded scenario, the purchase consideration will be US$140 million and the total acquisition cost US$146 million.

While acquisition sizes are already limited by rising interest rates and wavering investor sentiment, Reit managers are also keeping an eye out for the effects of foreign exchange risks.

For example, PLife Reit said both its acquisitions will be fully funded by yen-denominated debts to help insulate the Reit from ""potential currency volatility"".

""The deployment of Japanese yen (JPY) funding provides a natural hedge for the foreign exchange risks arising from JPY denominated assets,"" the manager said."
2022-10-10,Retail S-Reits see double-digit pickup; downtown malls shine,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/mobile-spotlight/retail-s-reits-see-double-digit-pickup-downtown,"RECENT consumer and leisure activities have picked up domestically with F1 Singapore Grand Prix's sold-out record crowd of over 302,000 fans, return of major concerts and meetings, incentives, conferences & exhibitions (Mice) activities, and the gradual pickup in tourist arrivals in recent months.

Retail sales in Singapore went up by 13 per cent year on year (yoy) in August, marking its fifth consecutive month of double-digit yoy growth. Growth in retail sales was attributed to increases recorded in most of the retail sales segments including apparel and footwear, department store sales, and food and alcohol sales. On a month-on-month basis, the majority of the industries suffered a drop in sales with petrol service stations seeing the largest dip of 8.2 per cent.

Listed on the SGX are 7 S-Reits which have significant exposure to Singapore-based retail assets.
CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U 0% reported 15.9 per cent yoy growth in retail tenant sales and 12.5 per cent yoy growth in shopper traffic for H1 2022. Double-digit growth was led by downtown malls with 26.4 per cent yoy growth in tenant sales and 14.5 per cent yoy growth in shopper traffic.

VivoCity Mall, a key retail mall in Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust : N2IU +0.74%'s portfolio, saw shopper traffic grow 50.9 per cent yoy and tenant sales increase 53.3 per cent yoy in Q1 FY2022/2023.
Suntec Reit : T82U -1.72%'s net property income (NPI) for its retail portfolio in H1 2022 improved 41.5 per cent yoy, while NPI for its convention portfolio turned positive in Q2 2022 driven by corporate events, conferences, and long-term licences. The Reit believes that its convention business is on the road to recovery, driven by domestic consumer and corporate events and the return of small-scale international Mice events.
Frasers Centrepoint Trust : J69U +1.46% reported Q3 2022 shopper traffic and tenants' sales grew 32 per cent and 23 per cent yoy respectively. Tampines 1 and Waterway Point led in tenant sales growth, while all its malls recorded double-digit yoy improvements in shopper traffic.
SPH Reit : SK6U +0.62%'s Paragon Mall's 3Q22 sales saw a marked recovery at 45 per cent yoy growth, driven by the removal of most travel restrictions, to pre-Covid levels. The Clementi Mall continued with resilient sales tracking above pre-pandemic levels supported by strong food and beverage performance.
Lendlease Global Commercial Reit : JYEU +0.98% reported stronger recovery in Q4 2022 tenant sales, surpassing pre-Covid average, and faster than shopper visitation. Its retail portfolio maintains healthy leasing at 99.6 per cent occupancy rate.
Starhill Global Reit : P40U -1.03% reported full year FY21/22 strong committed occupancy rates of 98.6 per cent. Its master lease rent review with Toshin, master tenant for Ngee Ann City contributing approximately 23 per cent of the Reit's portfolio gross rent, was completed at prevailing rent and up to June 2025."
2022-10-11,Brokers’ take: Analysts positive on SPH Reit’s near-term prospects as tenant sales recover,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/brokers-take-analysts-positive-sph-reits-near-term-prospects-tenant-sales-recover,"CGS-CIMB and DBS Group Research have maintained their respective ""hold"" calls on SPH Reit while noting improved operating metrics and tenant sentiment as well as recovering portfolio reversions.

This comes after the real estate investment trust (Reit) reported a 2.2 per cent rise in distribution per unit (DPU) for the 12 months ended August 2022, boosted by increased footfall and subsequent tenant sales recovery at its Singapore assets.

In a report on Monday (Oct 10), analysts of CGS-CIMB highlighted an improvement in FY2022 portfolio reversions compared to the previous year despite remaining negative.
They think SPH Reit's portfolio could start showing positive reversions going forward, noting improved valuations for both its Singapore and Australian assets due to higher rental income and stable cap rates.

The Reit could also potentially improve asset efficiency under the direction of its new property-led sponsor Cuscaden Peak, they added.

CGS-CIMB has tweaked its FY2022 to FY2024 estimates for SPH Reit by 0.1 per cent to 33.7 per cent to factor in a change in financial year end as well as raised rental growth assumptions, resulting in a slightly higher price target of S$0.96 on the Reit compared to S$0.95 previously.
Meanwhile, DBS Group Research continues to like SPH Reit as one of the key beneficiaries of Singapore's reopening - particularly its anchor asset Paragon Mall, where tenant sales for FY2022 have reached about 89 per cent of 2019 levels.

Its analysts also believe there are ""good reasons"" to expect a festive boost to the Reit's operating metrics in the first quarter ending December 2022 alongside strong monthly traction of tourist arrivals to Singapore.

""Indonesian and Chinese spenders are the two titans when it comes to tourist spending at Paragon, making up about 16 per cent of mall footfall respectively. We expect developments on China's border reopening to be a key catalyst for the stock,"" they said.

The research house's price target on the Reit remains unchanged at S$0.96.

At its latest closing price of S$0.895 on Monday the counter trades at an ""compelling yield"" of 6.1 per cent on a forward basis and below book at 0.97 times price-to-book, noted its analysts.

They also like SPH Reit for its low gearing, resilient position in comparison to its peers, and ""diminishing gap"" on negative reversions based on the Reit's latest set of full-year results.

""SPH Reit stands as one of the lowest geared within the S-Reits sector with an aggregate leverage of 30 per cent (as at end-August). With an estimated 70 per cent of borrowings on fixed interest rate, a 10 basis points increase in interest rate (assuming 100 per cent floating debt) will translate to a 0.5 per cent impact on DPU,"" said the analysts.

Units of SPH Reit : SK6U +0.62% were trading unchanged at S$0.895 as at 11.40am on Tuesday."
2022-10-13,GuocoLand can unlock value just by listing Guoco Tower as a single-property Reit,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/mobile-spotlight/guocoland-can-unlock-value-just-listing-guoco-tower,"THIS Friday (Oct 14), at 10am, shareholders of real estate group GuocoLand : F17 0% will have the opportunity to pose questions to management at the company's annual general meeting. On the agenda, perhaps, will be how the board and management hope to unlock value for shareholders.

The group, in which tycoon Quek Leng Chan holds a direct and deemed interest of about 72 per cent, traded at a 58 per cent discount to its end-June net asset value (NAV) per share of S$3.86, based on its close on Wednesday at S$1.64.

There are reasons to be positive about the group's prospects. GuocoLand posted a 122 per cent rise in net profit for the six months ended Jun 30. And 84 per cent of the homes in its Lentor Modern project were sold over two days at its launch last month. But the jewel in GuocoLand's crown is, arguably, Guoco Tower in Tanjong Pagar, in the Central Business District (CBD).
Market watchers are positive on the outlook for Singapore's premium CBD office buildings. Consultancy Colliers forecasts that core CBD premium and Grade-A office rentals will grow by between 6 and 7 per cent this year.

As at end-June, the office and retail space of Guoco Tower, which sits on leasehold land with over 87 years outstanding, had a committed occupancy of 100 per cent and was valued at S$2.68 billion. For context, GuocoLand's market capitalisation is around S$1.9 billion.
For property developers like GuocoLand, the conventional means of unlocking value has been to recycle capital by selling assets to real estate investment trusts (Reits). This is an option for GuocoLand, which held nearly S$6 billion worth of investment properties as at the end of June. Yet, the company also has the opportunity to try something new - by listing a single-property Reit with Guoco Tower in it.

The introduction of Reits has enabled retail investors to own fractions in many properties that would previously have been inaccessible. Shoppers can assess the crowds at VivoCity, Bugis Junction or Paragon, and ride on the success of their preferred malls.

But as Reits scale up, exposure to any one particular asset gets diluted. An investor in Singapore's first Reit, CapitaMall Trust, would have bought exposure to three malls here at the time of listing. But after a merger and multiple acquisitions, the recently renamed CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U 0% (CICT) owns malls, offices and integrated developments, spread across Singapore, Australia and Germany.

Reits chase scale via asset acquisitions and mergers, to draw institutional investor interest. A larger portfolio of assets offers greater diversification, and asset acquisitions can boost a trust's distribution per unit (DPU).

Some investors may dislike acquisitive Reits, however, as acquisitions can alter an investor's exposure to a segment or geography. When an acquisitive trust raises equity, an investor's interest may be diluted. Investors might instead welcome a Singapore-focused Reit committed to owning its initial portfolio for 20 years or more, and not making acquisitions. Actively managing leases, market rental growth and asset-enhancement initiatives can drive DPU growth at such a Reit. After two decades or more, the Reit could be wound up upon selling its asset - possibly for a profit.

Family offices and insurance funds may like such vehicles too, as some of these investors buy commercial buildings or strata commercial spaces.

If Guoco Tower is injected into a Reit at a net property income yield of around 4 per cent, the hypothetical Reit's initial annual DPU yield could be around the mid-4 per cent. Such a yield is in line with the recent five-year green bond offered by Frasers Property : TQ5 +0.61%(FPL) paying an annual interest rate of 4.49 per cent. There would also be a chance of capital gains from the Reit.

Unit prices of Reits have weakened amid rising interest rates. CICT, for instance, traded at an 11 per cent discount to its end-June NAV and an annualised DPU yield of 5.6 per cent.

A Reit that owns a top-grade asset here and eliminates the risks associated with acquisitions could, perhaps, trade at a lower yield than acquisitive geographically-diversified Reits. GuocoLand could distribute units in the hypothetical Guoco Tower Reit to its shareholders and/or sell units to new investors. While investors may apply a slight discount to the said Reit's NAV, any such discount should be much less than GuocoLand's discount to its NAV.

Owning Singapore real estate
Owning property is a hedge against inflation. Owning assets in Singapore, which is stable and has a strong currency, is attractive. Buying homes for investment, however, is tricky, as Singapore citizens pay hefty taxes when buying multiple homes.  

Owning strata space in commercial buildings can be difficult, as the Urban Redevelopment Authority prohibits the strata subdivision of commercial developments as well as the commercial components of mixed-use developments located in prominent areas and routes in Singapore's Central Area.

Reits that own prime Singapore properties and eschew acquisitions can offer investors exposure to top-grade assets to help fund retirement needs. Such Reits may need to look largely to retail investors for support. But retail investors do have firepower, as evidenced by the take-up for FPL's recent green bond. It raised S$350 million from the public offer tranche, and S$150 million from the placement tranche that was taken up by private banks and institutions.

GuocoLand can lead by launching Guoco Tower Reit, perhaps in 2023, if interest rates stop rising and a suitable capital market window opens.
Should the said Reit be well received, other property owners can follow suit. GuocoLand could subsequently launch a Reit that owns the office and retail space of the upcoming Guoco Midtown in Beach Road.

2022-10-16,Maiden acquisitions made by S-Reits in September,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/maiden-acquisitions-made-s-reits-september,"S-REIT acquisitions continued to pick up despite rising rates, with six S-Reits announcing deals in September, valued at approximately S$2.7 billion in total. These deals included property types such as data centres, logistics, healthcare as well as retail, and span across Germany, the United States, Japan and Singapore. 

The month of September also saw maiden acquisitions from Digital Core Reit and Daiwa House Logistics Trust since their respective initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2021. 

Daiwa House Logistics Trust : DHLU -0.91% (DHLT) announced the proposed acquisition of two freehold logistics facilities and a piece of freehold land located in Japan from sponsor Daiwa House Industry for a total consideration of 4.68 billion yen (S$45.1 million), representing a 11.8 per cent discount to the properties' average appraised value.
The Reit manager expects the acquisition to increase the distribution per unit (DPU) for FY2022 by 1.3 per cent, on a pro forma basis. It also noted that the acquisition will diversify its portfolio across various regions in Japan, reducing geographical concentration risk while mitigating potential impact from earthquakes. 

Digital Core Reit : DCRU +0.99% (DCREIT) has agreed to purchase a 25 per cent stake in a freehold data centre in Frankfurt, Germany, valued at US$558 million from its sponsor, Digital Realty, with the option to acquire up to 89.9 per cent interest in the Frankfurt facility and a 90 per cent interest in a freehold data centre in Dallas, Texas, valued at US$199 million. The eventual scenario will depend upon whether DCREIT raises capital through a debt or equity fundraising to partially fund the transaction. 
The acquisition is expected to be DPU accretive by 2 per cent, or 3.1 per cent should DCREIT proceed with the larger deal. It would also allow DCREIT to expand into two new markets and reduce market concentration.
Aside from these two, there were also several Japan acquisitions made by healthcare S-Reits last month, including ParkwayLife Reit and First Reit. 

ParkwayLife Reit : C2PU -0.27% completed two acquisitions in September, comprising two nursing homes in the Greater Tokyo region from Daiwa House Industry for a total consideration of 2.88 billion yen as well as three nursing homes - Blue Terrace Kagura, Blue Rise Nopporo and Blue Terrace Taisetsu - from Blue Melon Capital Kabushiki Kaisha and its subsidiary for a total consideration of 2.56 billion yen.

First Reit : AW9U +2.17% completed the acquisition of two nursing homes, Loyal Residence Ayase and Medical Rehabilitation Home Bon Sejour Komaki for a total purchase consideration of 2.6 billion yen. It noted that Japan is one of the key growth markets for First Reit, having completed the acquisition of 12 nursing homes earlier this year. The acquisitions are also in line with the First Reit 2.0 Growth Strategy to step up growth in developed markets to form more than 50 per cent of its portfolio."
2022-10-17,"Despite travel recovering, listed hospitality plays are unloved and may be privatised",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/despite-travel-recovering-listed-hospitality-plays-are-unloved-and-may-be,"SINGAPORE'S opening up along with that of many countries has led to a rise in international visitor arrivals, as well as hotel room and occupancy rates. Hotels here are also buoyed by the return of large scale events and relaxation of dining-in restrictions.

Perhaps because of optimism in the prospects for hospitality assets, some stapled security holders voted down the proposed privatisation of Frasers Hospitality Trust : ACV 0% (FHT), which owns hotels and serviced residences in Singapore, the United Kingdom (UK), Australia, Malaysia, Germany and Japan, in September. The privatisation offer price of S$0.70 per stapled security was at above FHT's book value.

Opponents of FHT's privatisation may have scored a pyrrhic victory - as at Oct 14, 2022, FHT traded at 35 per cent below the privatisation offer price.
FHT is hardly alone in trading in the doldrums. As at Oct 14, 2022, major hotel groups Mandarin Oriental International : M04 -2.44%and Shangri-La Asia : S07 0% traded at discount to adjusted net asset value (NAV) as at end-June of 53 per cent and 79 per cent respectively. The adjusted NAV takes into account market value of the hotels. The discount to NAV of Mandarin Oriental and Shangri-La Asia are 29 per cent and 58 per cent respectively.
As at Oct 14, 2022, the discount to end-June NAV of groups with large exposure to hospitality assets such as Amara : A34 -2.25%, Banyan Tree : B58 +1.28%, Far East Orchard : O10 -2.88%, and Hotel Royal : H12 0% : H15 -1.37%are 51 per cent, 52 per cent, 61 per cent and 58 per cent respectively. Bonvests : B28 -0.98% traded at discount to end-June NAV of 56 per cent as at Oct 12, 2022.

Amid risk aversion among investors, stapled group CDL Hospitality Trusts : J85 -0.98% (CDLHT) has seen the price of its securities come under pressure. Still, as at Oct 14, 2022, CDLHT traded at a superior book value multiple to the above groups of 0.8 times end-June NAV. CDLHT's price per stapled unit is up 25 per cent versus its initial public offering price of S$0.83.
CDLHT's portfolio as at end-June comprised 19 operational properties, including a total of 4,821 rooms and a retail mall, as well as one build-to-rent project in the pipeline with 352 apartment units, spread across eight countries.
Among listed options, stapled trusts may be more efficient than companies as vehicles to own hospitality assets. Stapled trusts have high level of distribution of taxable income, which some investors can receive without tax deduction at source. While investor confidence in hospitality trusts was hit by the woes afflicting Eagle Hospitality Trust, which is now being wound up, this case may be seen as an aberration.

Perhaps, listed companies that own hospitality assets should undertake reviews to see if shareholder value can be created by using stapled trusts to hold such assets. Maybe property group, UOL Group : U14 0%, can emulate major developers City Developments Limited : C09 -0.3%, Far East Organization and Frasers Property : TQ5 +0.61% by setting up a listed hospitality trust. UOL, which owns 26 hotels and service suites with over 9,000 rooms, according to its latest results presentation, can set up a trust that offers scale.

Investors are comfortable investing in Singapore-listed trusts, and listed hospitality trusts can raise equity to fund growth. CapitaLand Ascott Trust : HMN -1.12%(Clas), which is the largest hospitality trust in Asia-Pacific, raised aggregate gross proceeds of around S$170 million from a private placement of new stapled securities in August. The fundraising was largely to help fund the proposed acquisition of interests in serviced residences in France, Vietnam and Australia, rental housing properties in Japan and a student housing property in the United States.

Moreover, the income volatility of hospitality trusts is manageable as the trusts can earn revenue from master leases agreements where there is a fixed rent component and/or variable rent component, which is typically tied to revenue and/or operating profit. Adding student and/or rental housing assets helps boost the defensiveness of the portfolios of Clas and CDLHT.

If existing hospitality trusts bulk up and/or improve their free float, they might attract greater interest from institutional investors and trade better. As at end-June, Clas had total assets of S$7.6 billion, versus CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U 0%, and CapitaLand Ascendas Reit : A17U 0%, which had total assets of S$24.7 billion and S$17.4 billion respectively.

Privatisation route

However, stapled hospitality trusts are facing headwinds as investors cool to interest rate sensitive yield plays such as listed trusts amid rising interest rates. Perhaps, privatisation better solves the under valuation of listed hospitality plays.

In 2021, GL Limited and Fragrance Group were delisted from the Singapore Exchange due to privatisation exercises. The former's key assets are hotels in the UK, while the latter is mainly a property and hotel group, which held various hotels in Australia and the UK.

Conditions may be ripe for privatisation of listed hospitality plays.

Firstly, the hospitality sector is recovering strongly in Singapore and many places. Emerging from the Covid-pandemic, people are keen to travel for leisure or business. Singapore's international visitor arrivals grew for the eighth consecutive month in September. This year's Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix drew a record 302,000 fans, including many overseas attendees. Many Singaporeans are looking to take overseas year-end holidays.

Owners of hotels here can leverage Singapore's position as a premier destination for leisure and business travel, which will be boosted by investments to upgrade the airport and improve attractions.

Secondly, hotels can cope with rising inflation. Unlike commercial properties, which have tenancy agreements that lock-in fixed rental rates for a prolonged period, hotels can revise room rates upwards fairly quickly.

Coming out of the Covid-pandemic, travellers may value health and safety as well as seek to be pampered. As such, hotels providing a premier experience can enjoy pricing power.

Thirdly, capital values of hotels may be well-supported in the investment sales market. Stamford Land Corporation : H07 0% entered into an agreement in October to sell the property that houses the hotel Stamford Plaza Auckland in New Zealand for NZ$152 million (S$123 million), which is 8.5 per cent above market valuation as at end-March. Stamford Land has also inked an agreement to sell Sir Stamford at Circular Quay, Sydney, Australia, which is mainly used as a hotel.

Parties will be careful with deployment of capital in a slowing economy, and the outcomes of privatisation offers can be uncertain. But a weak stock market may tempt some parties to make opportunistic privatisation offers, as battered investors may be more inclined to cash-in.

2022-10-19,Market keeps watch on S-Reits’ debt levels as rising interest rates crush confidence,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/market-keeps-watch-s-reits-debt-levels-rising-interest-rates-crush-confidence,"THE likelihood of a higher-for-longer interest rate environment has gutted investor sentiment towards real estate investment trusts (Reits).

""The latest projected pace of rate hike (in the September meeting) was higher than market anticipated, which has resulted in heightened market uncertainty,"" said RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan. He expects the US Federal Funds Rate to peak at close to 4.6 per cent by 2023.

The result has been a particularly bruising month for Singapore-listed Reits (S-Reits) in September.
DBS analysts noted that S-Reits were down close to 7.3 per cent month on month (m-o-m) in September - underperforming the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI), which fell close to 2.8 per cent m-o-m.

Reits have, in the past, outperformed during inflationary periods. But the present inflationary environment is also bringing with it sharply higher interest rates that limit access to capital for acquisitions.

There are also concerns that Reits with higher levels of unhedged or floating debt will be badly affected, which could lead to significant declines in distributions.
The market has already punished those S-Reits with the highest aggregated leverage. The four S-Reits with the highest gearing ratios - Lippo Malls Indonesia Retail Trust (LMIRT) : D5IU 0%, Ara US Hospitality Trust : XZL -3.7%, Suntec Reit : T82U -1.72% and Manulife US Reit (MUST) : BTOU -5.66% - are trading at steep discounts to their net asset value (NAV).

The quartet have aggregated leverage of between 42.4 per cent and 43.9 per cent, based on latest company filings extracted mid-August. In contrast, S-Reits had an average gearing ratio of 36.8 per cent.

These highly leveraged Reits were also trading at discounts of between 32 per cent and 65 per cent to book, Bloomberg data as at Oct 14 showed.

Nevertheless, investors are keeping an eye on more than just debt-to-asset ratios.

Take the case of LMIRT. The Indonesia-focused retail Reit's cost of debt is among the highest cost in the S-Reit universe, at nearly 7 per cent.

Meanwhile, it has a low interest coverage ratio - which measures a company's ability to meet required interest expense payments related to its outstanding debt obligations - of just 2.1 times.

As at Jun 30, LMIRT held a cash balance of S$120.1 million; and S$135 million in term loans and another S$7 million for a revolving loan facility will come due by the end of 2023.

Only 42.8 per cent of its borrowings is hedged to fixed interest rates - one of the lowest levels among the S-Reits. This means more than half of LMIRT's borrowings will be affected by rising interest rates.

This confluence of factors has contributed to LMIRT being one of the worst performing S-Reits in the past year. The Reit has lost 45.8 per cent of its value in the 12 months to Oct 14, with a total return of negative 41.8 per cent.

On the other hand, Suntec Reit, which also has a high gearing ratio and low proportion of debt hedged to fixed interest rates, has performed significantly better.

While trading at a 32 per cent discount to book, it is the only one among the 10 Reits with the highest gearing ratios to generate a positive total return in the one-year period to Oct 14.

This could be attributable to optimism over Suntec Reit's office portfolio, as well as recovery in the retail and convention segments amid the post-pandemic reopening.

Investors are also more likely to be soothed by Suntec Reit's more comfortable interest coverage ratio of 2.7 times and relatively low cost of debt at about 2.5 per cent.

""Concerns over the impact of financing cost from rising interest rates are slightly overblown in our view, and we expect organic growth to outpace inflation,"" RHB's Natarajan said in an earlier report on Suntec Reit.

The way the DBS analysts see it, a potential drop in inflationary pressures - expected to peak in the second half of 2022 before tapering off in 2023 - will be a general positive for S-Reits as it will lift the overhang of cost and interest rate pressures on distributions.

""While we see that there are uncertainties regarding the S-Reits' ability to continue delivering growth in the face of cost headwinds (such as interest rates and inflation), we believe that an improvement in margin trends starting in the third quarter of 2022 will provide stability for the sector,"" the analysts said.

""While earnings risks are present, we believe a substantial part of the risk factors have been priced in at the current levels,"" they added."
2022-10-19,"Slump in equity-guzzling Reits, Sats are signs of a coming ice age for the stock market",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/mobile-spotlight/slump-equity-guzzling-reits-sats-are-signs-coming-ice-age,"THE Straits Times Index (STI) lurched below the 3,000 mark for about 45 minutes during early trading on Monday (Oct 17). But it managed to claw its way back up to close at 3,015.75 - 0.8 per cent below where it ended the preceding week.

With central banks around the world - including the Monetary Authority of Singapore - committed to fighting inflation, it is possible that the local market benchmark will eventually plumb below that psychologically significant threshold with more conviction in the weeks and months ahead.

This could have adverse implications for the 30 companies and real estate investment trusts (Reits) that form the STI, as well as the broader market. In particular, raising equity for any kind of growth initiative is likely to become more difficult.
An excessively weak market in the face of tightening monetary policy could also make investors perversely resistant to privatisation offers, a common value-unlocking move in the local market.

Last month, minority investors shot down a proposal for Frasers Hospitality Trust to be taken private by its sponsor group at a 7 per cent premium to its book value. Concerns that the offer was opportunistically timed might have fuelled the resistance.

While the STI has held up relatively well this year - it has posted a negative year-to-date return of minus 3.3 per cent as at Oct 17 - signs of a coming ice age in the local market have been evident for a while.

For instance, equity-guzzling Reits began falling out of favour last year in the wake of incessant placements for asset acquisitions that were barely accretive to their distributions per unit (DPUs).

This year, half of the 10 worst performing components of the STI have been Reits: Mapletree Industrial Trust, Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust, Mapletree Logistics Trust, Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (FLCT) and Keppel DC Reit (KDC).

And, the worst performing of these Reits were among the most richly priced only a year ago.

Falling former stalwarts
The worst-performing component of the STI this year has been KDC - with a total return of minus 31.2 per cent, as at Oct 17.

KDC was the first ""pure-play"" data centre Reit when it listed in December 2014, with assets under management of S$1 billion.

When KDC was included in the STI in October 2020, its manager noted that its assets under management (AUM) had nearly trebled to S$2.8 billion and that investors who bought units at the initial public offering would have earned a total return of 388 per cent.

As it happened, that was pretty much the peak for KDC. While its AUM has since expanded to S$3.5 billion as at Jun 30, the market value of its units has declined significantly.

On Oct 17, KDC was trading at an annualised H1 2022 DPU yield of 5.9 per cent and a 24.1 per cent premium to its Jun 30 book value. At the end of last year, the Reit was trading at a 2021 DPU yield of 4 per cent and an 84.3 per cent premium to its Dec 31 book value.

The second worst performing Reit within the STI this year has been FLCT - with a total return of negative 27.6 per cent, as at Oct 17.

Formerly known as Frasers Logistics & Industrial Trust, FLCT was significantly enlarged in 2020 after subsuming Frasers Commercial Trust in a controversial merger. Despite growing much bigger, the market valuation of its units has slipped considerably as interest rates rose and excitement about e-commerce waned with the end of the pandemic.

As at Oct 17, FLCT was trading at an annualised H1 FY2022 DPU yield of 7 per cent and a 16.7 per cent discount to its Mar 31 book value. At the end of last year, FLCT was trading at an FY2021 DPU yield of 5.1 per cent and a 22.6 per cent premium to its Sep 30, 2021 book value.

The remarkable erosion of these Reits' valuations will probably make raising funds for acquisitions a challenge.

No appetite for acquisitions
One stock that has reacted especially badly to the prospect of raising money for an acquisition recently is Sats.

The aviation services provider last month said it will pay some S$1.8 billion to acquire Worldwide Flight Services, the largest air cargo handler in the world. The company plans to ultimately fund the deal by raising equity from shareholders and new strategic investors.

Instead of waiting to reap rewards from an expected recovery in earnings and dividends as international borders reopen, investors may soon have to dig into their pockets and watch Sats grapple with the complicated task of integrating a big air cargo handling business in the face of rising interest rates and a slowing global economy.

Since the market got wind of the deal, Sats has lost about one-third - or some S$1.5 billion - of its market value. Ironically, this big slump makes it all the more likely that Sats will eventually have to tap its own shareholders rather than strategic investors for the cash it needs.

As monetary policy is tightened around the world to curb inflation, the market valuations of companies will be tested against their supposed financial resilience. And, only the most compelling corporate deals are likely to get a warm reception. Investors should adopt a skeptical attitude and tread very carefully."
2022-10-19,Upcoming Q3 results will be pivotal following one of the worst market routs since S-Reits’ inception,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/mobile-spotlight/upcoming-q3-results-will-be-pivotal-following-one-worst-market,"AMID one of the worst sell-offs in the 20-year history of Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits), market watchers are paying special attention as S-Reits start to release their results and quarterly business updates for the period ended Sep 30.
Gabriel Yap, chairman of investment firm GCP Global, noted that the FTSE ST Real Estate Investment Trusts (Reits) Index has tumbled over 20 per cent since April.
""This is the second-worst correction for S-Reits, not including the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2009, and the pandemic sell-off of March 2020,"" he said. ""We are finally getting into a very 'blood on the streets' situation for Reit investors and traders.""
The veteran Reit investor added that the current correction - now into its sixth month - is the third longest in S-Reit history, with the last interest rate upcycle sell-off of 2018 lasting 10 months, and the 2013 Taper Tantrum correction stretching nine months.
As the S-Reits start to announce their results for the third quarter over the coming weeks, Yap said he will keep an eye on ""metrics that indicate the robustness of the balance sheet and the resiliency of the Reit to go through the interest-rate upcycle"".
These include looking at a Reit's cost of funds, interest cover, gearing ratio, proportion of loans expiring in the second half 2022 and 2023, extent of currency hedging, as well as the type of currencies in which the loans were taken out, he added.
Apart from the impact of rising interest rates, RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan said he would also pay close attention to a couple of other factors: One is net property income (NPI) margins, and any potential margin compression from inflationary pressures and rising utility charges; another would be the pricing power of the Reit in terms of rent reversions and occupancy trends, he said.

""In Singapore, we will be watching industrial Reits' operating metrics and outlook to get a better picture of the strength of demand and supply, and the impact from the manufacturing slowdown seen in latest monthly data,"" he said.

""This, in our view, could also be a bellwether for the economic outlook ahead.""

Sabana Industrial Reit : M1GU +1.3%, the first S-Reit to announce its results for the period ended September, will give investors a taste of what is to come.

In an interim business update for Q3 on Wednesday (Oct 19), it reported an increase in portfolio occupancy to 89.1 per cent as at end September, up from 88.2 per cent in the preceding quarter. The Reit manager said this was a new high since Q3 2017.

The Singapore-focused industrial Reit managed to achieve positive rental reversion of 10.2 per cent in the latest quarter, slipping from 17.4 per cent in Q2.

Sabana Reit's aggregate leverage edged up 0.3 percentage point to 33.7 per cent as at end September, while its average all-in financing cost climbed 42 basis points to 3.77 per cent.

On a positive note, some 73.3 per cent of its borrowings are hedged to fixed interest rates, with no refinancing due until 2024.

The next results announcement investors will be looking out for this week will be from CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT) : C38U 0% - Singapore's first and largest Reit - which is to release its Q3 business update this Friday.

The following week will bring the trio of Mapletree Reits - Mapletree Logistics Trust (MLT) : M44U 0%, Mapletree Industrial Trust (Mint) : ME8U -0.46% and Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust (MPACT) : N2IU +0.74% - into focus.

MLT and Mint will report their results for H1 FY2022/2023 on Oct 25 and Oct 26, respectively; MPACT will do so for its H1 results on Oct 27- its first such announcement post-merger.

Oct 26 is shaping up to be a busy day for the market, with Frasers Centrepoint Trust (FCT) : J69U +1.46% reporting its results for FY2022 and Aims Apac Reit : O5RU -0.78% announcing its H1 FY2022 results.

Other full-year results announcements to look out for include Frasers Hospitality Trust (FHT) : ACV 0% - fresh from its failed privatisation attempt - on Nov 4, and Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (FLCT) : BUOU +0.94% on Nov 10.

Bringing up the rear for the S-Reits reporting season will be several of the foreign Reits, including Manulife US Reit : BTOU -5.66% (Nov 2), ARA US Hospitality Trust : XZL -3.7% (Nov 4), Prime US Reit : OXMU -4.88% (Nov 8) and United Hampshire US Reit : ODBU 0% (Nov 9).

""For Reits in the overseas market, we will be particularly monitoring the office Reits in US and Europe in terms of return-to-office trends and physical occupancy to assess potential leasing impact from the evolving hybrid working model,"" said RHB's Natarajan.

GCP Global's Yap added: ""Recent events - such as the 'Truss, no trust anymore' fiasco in the United Kingdom, continued strength of the US dollar and historical lows for the Japanese yen - opens up the gate for foreign currency blowouts that you saw during the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997-1998.
""This time, the danger zone is those Reits whose assets are in this 'weak currency basis'."""
2022-10-24,CapitaLand Ascendas Reit targets further overseas expansion for greater resilience,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/capitaland-ascendas-reit-targets-further-overseas-expansion-greater-resilience,"WILLIAM Tay, chief executive officer of the manager of CapitaLand Ascendas Reit (Clar : A17U 0%), wants to increase the proportion of overseas assets in the Singapore-listed real estate investment trust (S-Reit)'s portfolio, with the intent of gaining resilience through diversification.

As of end June, some 61 per cent of Clar's S$16.6 billion portfolio of investment properties are based in Singapore. The United States accounts for 15 per cent of its portfolio by asset value, with another 14 per cent based in Australia, and the remaining 10 per cent in the United Kingdom and Europe.

This geographical diversification into developed markets, Tay said, has given Singapore's largest industrial S-Reit by market capitalisation and assets under management (AUM) ""a very strong base"".""In the past few years, where there was a lot of uncertainty, we didn't see a big move in terms of negative impact to the Reit because the overseas markets provide a very different profile to Singapore's leases.,"" Tay said.

For example, he pointed out that one of the merits of having overseas assets for the Reit is the inclusion of annual rental escalations in the leases - unlike the flat rate leases typically signed in Singapore - which provides a boost in income each year.
He believes Clar has won investors over with its prudent and well-executed expansion into overseas markets.

""When you first go overseas, naturally everybody will be very concerned,"" Tay said. ""But we've demonstrated since day one that we are prudent… Over the past few years, investors have seen that we are able to deliver and execute, whether it's in Australia, the UK, Europe or the US. Frankly, I don't hear any of these concerns any more.""

""We look at our price to net asset value (NAV) for the past five years. It's actually much higher than when we were Singapore-focused, which means that investors have confidence in our overseas strategy,"" he added.

The way Tay sees it, investors are cognisant that there are limited opportunities in Singapore, and that expansion into markets overseas is necessary to have ""proper diversification"".

Going forward, the manager said it is likely to focus on growth opportunities in the countries and continents where Clar already has a presence, which will also help increase economies of scale and efficiency for the Reit.

""Over time, I will not be surprised that overseas markets become a larger portion (of the portfolio). But Singapore will probably still be the single largest market,"" Tay said.

""There are still billions of dollars of assets to be acquired in Singapore,"" he added, noting that Clar has made two acquisitions in Singapore so far this year: the Philips Apac Centre in Toa Payoh for S$104.8 million and a cold storage logistics facility at Buroh Lane for S$191.9 million.

Amid surging interest rates and inflation, however, Clar - like its S-Reit peers - has seen a significant slowdown in acquisition activity.

To continue to boost the Reit's growth, Tay said Clar will explore other opportunities, such as the conversion of some of its existing properties to capture organic growth.

Clar on Sep 30 announced it has signed a lease agreement that will see it convert an existing office asset into a life sciences property at an estimated cost of US$40 million.

Following the completion of the convert-to-suit exercise in the fourth quarter of 2023, the manager said Clar is expected to receive a higher base rent with an annual escalation of 3 per cent. The net property income yield of the asset will also be raised to 9 per cent.

""Convert-to-suit is simpler in the sense that there's an existing building, so the core and shell - the bones of the building - are already there,"" Tay said. ""Construction time is shorter, and that actually offers tenants the opportunity to start production or their work earlier.""

With a portfolio of over 200 properties, the Reit manager said there will inherently be opportunities for more of these convert-to-suit projects.

""If you look at Singapore, we have many assets that are now sitting near new infrastructures,"" Tay said.

For example, Tay said that when a new MRT line or station is built near one of its assets in Singapore, the Reit manager has offered to do a convert-to-suit for its customers. Internally, he added, the Reit manager also considers whether it could redevelop and enhance the asset.

Amid the global economic uncertainty, Tay said the ""immediate focus"" for Clar is to ensure that its base is resilient and that its balance sheet remains healthy.

As at end June, Clar had an aggregate leverage of 36.7 per cent, giving it an available debt headroom of about S$4.6 billion to the regulatory limit of 50 per cent.

Some 80 per cent of its total debt has been hedged to fixed interest rates, and it enjoys a low weighted average all-in debt cost of 2.1 per cent. The Reit also has a weighted average debt tenure of 3.9 years and an interest coverage ratio of 6.1 times.

In addition, the Reit manager said its A3 credit rating by Moody's ""facilitates good access to wider funding options at competitive rates"".

""I think we have already put in all the metrics to ride out (the uncertainty and higher-for-longer interest rates),"" Tay said. ""To continue to still be able to enjoy this low debt costs, it gives us the ability to plan ahead beyond the next 12 to 18 months.""

Units of Clar have fallen about 14.1 per cent in the year to date (YTD) as at Oct 20, outperforming the FTSE ST Reits Index, which has lost 19.6 per cent. The Reit has an annualised total return of negative 3.7 per cent in the YTD, in what has been one of the worst sell-offs for the S-Reit market since April.

Over a longer timeframe, however, the numbers are more impressive.

Since its inception in 2002, Clar's unit price has trebled. It has also generated a total return of 908.2 per cent, or 12.3 per cent on an annualised basis.

""During these uncertain times, investors do want to put money in safe stocks,"" Tay said. ""We do see that Singapore benefits from being seen as a safe haven, and obviously Reits - and certain Reits like us - will be seen as safe because we have demonstrated over time that we are very stable.""
""Singapore offers leasehold (properties) and is very stable in terms of lease rates and all that. But if you want to make sure that this continues to be resilient, we need to build up a different platform. The overseas platform offers freehold and escalation per annum in the lease,"" Tay said.

2022-10-23,S-Reits confirm schedule for latest results and updates,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/s-reits-confirm-schedule-latest-results-and-updates,"SOME 33 S-Reits and property trusts have confirmed dates of their upcoming financial results or business updates for this reporting season, with SPH Reit : SK6U +0.62% kicking off the release of its full year FY22 financial results, along with Sabana Industrial Reit's : M1GU +1.3% Q3 FY22 business update. 

As rising interest rates and inflationary pressures continue to be drivers for the sector, investors will be keeping a close eye on the sector's operational resiliency and balance sheet strengths. 

SPH Reit reported higher distribution per unit of 5.52 Singapore cents for the 12 months ended Aug 31, 2022, up 2.2 per cent from the previous year. The Reit reported 1.7 per cent increase in gross revenue and 3.5 per cent increase in net property income, alongside improvement in rental reversions with a -2.8 per cent portfolio rental reversion rate compared to -8.4 per cent a year ago. With continued emphasis on capital discipline, SPH Reit sees ample debt headroom with a gearing ratio of 30 per cent and a weighted average term to maturity of 2.5 years.
Sabana Industrial Reit updated that it reached portfolio occupancy levels of 89.1 per cent, a new high since Q3FY17. Excluding its Tuas Avenue facility that is currently undergoing asset enhancement, total occupancy would have been 92.2 per cent. The Reit has signed 83,588 sq ft of new leases with tenants primarily from the logistics & supply chain and media & publishing trade sectors. It also renewed 71,266 sq ft of leases with a positive rental reversion of 10.2 per cent, recording 10 positive quarterly reversions over the past 11 quarters. On capital management, aggregate leverage was 33.7 per cent with average borrowing maturity at three years. Looking ahead, the Reit will continue to pursue green initiatives across its portfolio as it looks to improve the assets' operational efficiency over the medium-term."
2022-10-24,"Headwinds emerging for office landlords, but tight supply situation could mitigate impact",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/headwinds-emerging-office-landlords-tight-supply-situation-could-mitigate-impact,"WHILE technology and social media firms have hogged the headlines in recent years for aggressively snapping up office space in the Central Business District (CBD), the mood has turned more cautious as funding dries up and interest rates keep climbing. Sea's e-commerce outfit Shopee and startup StashAway are among those that have already cut staff.

Against the backdrop of economic headwinds, leasing demand for office space could cool in 2023 as firms reassess expansion plans, while the growth in office rents should slow. However, thanks to Singapore's positioning as a financial hub, there could still be continued demand from the likes of family offices as well as from co-working operators, as companies rein in capital expenditure and favour flexibility.

CBD (Grade A) office rents could rise 5.5-6.5 per cent in 2022 before easing to 2-4 per cent in 2023, according to Cushman & Wakefield.
Aside from the tech companies, demand so far has been boosted in part by tenant displacement as office building owners redevelop ageing buildings, as well as from occupiers in the finance sector. There have also been spillover benefits from companies shifting their employees out of Hong Kong.

For now, the tight supply situation in the CBD remains a boon for office landlords, with the vacancy rate of CBD Grade A offices tracked by Cushman & Wakefield tightening to 3.6 per cent in Q3 2022 from 5.1 per cent in the previous quarter - even as hybrid working looks here to stay.

Cushman & Wakefield estimates that average monthly rents of CBD Grade A offices climbed 1.8 per cent quarter-on-quarter (qoq) to S$10.35 per square foot (psf) per month in Q3. CBD Grade B office rents edged up 1 per cent qoq as vacancy rates fell to 7.8 per cent, while city fringe and suburban office rents increased 1.3 per cent qoq as vacancy rates tightened to 5 per cent. Inflationary costs are also lifting conservancy charges for tenants.
Knight Frank estimates that 1.18 million sq ft of office space in gross floor area (GFA) will come onstream for 2022 as a whole, including over 770,000 sq ft of Grade A office space from mixed-use project Guoco Midtown along Beach Road. As at end-August, about 60 per cent of Guoco Midtown's office space had received pre-commitments (including advanced negotiations). DBS has a buy call on , citing maiden contributions from Guoco Midtown in FY23 as well as expected positive rental reversions from Guoco Tower.

Meanwhile, another 1.56 million sq ft in GFA is expected to be injected into the market in 2023, with a large chunk (about 1.49 million sq ft) coming from IOI Central Boulevard Towers in the CBD, Knight Frank data shows. IOI Central Boulevard Towers is said to be one-third pre-leased.

The economic challenges plaguing multinational corporations (MNCs), coupled with the comparative lack of fresh supply, is prompting companies to turn cautious when it comes to office space, said Savills in a recent report. ""When leases are due, companies are most likely to renew rather than move until business conditions improve.""

Still, Savills executive director (research & consultancy) Alan Cheong expects shadow space could emerge next year, especially from the tech firms that might want to stem their cash burn as a number had locked in long-term leases before funding turned scarce. Shadow space refers to excess space on an existing lease obligation that a tenant would like to give up by finding a replacement tenant for the landlord.

RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan told The Business Times: ""Our outlook has toned down compared to the last six months because the performance of the office sector is tied to the country's economic growth. But there are some factors supporting the office sector, so we still remain positive."" For instance, positive rental reversions clocked over recent quarters will start kicking in for office landlords over the next few quarters, he pointed out.

RHB lists and as preferred picks among the office landlords, citing their portfolios and quality of office stock. Suntec Reit is also seen benefiting from its exposure to the retail and the meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (Mice) sectors.  ""Landlords with offices in the CBD would also see slightly more demand"" than the likes of , Natarajan reckons, adding that the tenant base for Mapletree Business City in the Alexandra precinct is weighted towards tech and R&D firms.

DBS analyst Derek Tan prefers ""Grade A (office) plays, given that they have the best property attributes"", such as being certified as Green Mark buildings. ""Keppel Reit is the best leveraged,"" Tan added.

Meanwhile, the flight-to-quality in the office sector should continue given the heightened focus on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) as MNCs seek to reduce their carbon footprint by shifting to Grade A office buildings, analysts say. Grade B office buildings would likely feel the impact of this trend.

Between this and the limited supply, landlords of Grade A office assets are in a better place to deal with the headwinds that 2023 may bring. Amid the flight-to-quality, landlords of older buildings may need to consider investing in asset enhancement initiatives or redevelopment to remain attractive to tenants."
2022-10-25,Mapletree Logistics Trust posts 3.5% rise in Q2 DPU to S$0.02248,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/mapletree-logistics-trust-posts-35-rise-q2-dpu-s002248,"THE manager of Mapletree Logistics Trust (MLT) on Tuesday (Oct 25) announced a 3.5 per cent increase in distribution per unit (DPU) to S$0.02248 for the second quarter ended September, from S$0.02173 in the corresponding period a year ago, despite an enlarged unit base.
The amount distributable to unitholders rose 15.6 per cent to S$108 million, driven by higher revenue from existing properties and contributions from accretive acquisitions completed in Q1 FY22/23 and in FY21/22.
Gross revenue climbed 11.4 per cent to S$183.9 million, while net property income was 10.8 per cent higher at S$160 million.
Overall growth was moderated by the depreciation of foreign currencies - including the Japanese yen and South Korean won - against the Singapore dollar.
The real estate investment trust (Reit) manager said that, at the distribution level, the impact of weakening currencies is mitigated through the use of foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the income from overseas assets.
MLT's portfolio occupancy dipped marginally to 96.4 per cent as at end-September, from 96.8 per cent as at end-June.
This was mainly attributable to lower occupancy in Singapore, due to the conversion of several single-user assets (SUAs) to multi-tenanted buildings (MTBs), which resulted in transitory downtime at these properties.
MLT saw a positive average rental reversion of 3.5 per cent for leases signed in Q2. As at Sep 30, the weighted average lease expiry (WALE) by net lettable area (NLA) stood at 3.3 years.

On the capital management front, MLT's aggregate leverage ratio improved to 37 per cent as at end-September, from 37.2 per cent as at end-June.

Total debt outstanding decreased by S$96 million quarter on quarter to S$4.94 billion, mainly due to lower net translated loans attributable to the depreciation of the Japanese yen and Australian dollar against the Singapore dollar.

The weighted average borrowing cost stood at 2.5 per cent per annum for Q2, up from 2.3 per cent in Q1.

The Reit manager said its debt maturity profile remains ""well-staggered"" with an average debt duration of 3.6 years.

Some 82 per cent of MLT's debt is hedged or drawn in fixed rates, with about 72 per cent of its income stream for the next 12 months hedged into Singapore dollars.

In addition, the manager guided that every potential 25 basis point increase in base interest rates may result in a S$0.0001 decline in DPU per quarter.

""My main challenge is not so much the interest rate environment,"" Ng Kiat, chief executive officer of MLT's manager, said in a briefing accompanying the results announcement. ""In fact, banks are coming to us… because, in this very volatile climate, they would rather have blue-chip customers. So they are actually trying to get us to borrow more from them.""

""The one that is most difficult for us to control is the share price (and its impact on our cost of equity),"" she added. ""Our acquisition ability is hampered a lot more because of the cost of equity.""

Units of MLT have fallen 23.2 per cent in the year to date.

""MLT continued to deliver steady growth in DPU underpinned by our diversified portfolio. While overall occupancy rates have stayed resilient with positive rental reversions achieved for the quarter, we are mindful that market uncertainty has increased amid intensifying economic headwinds,"" Ng said.

""We will continue to focus on maintaining portfolio stability while driving our portfolio rejuvenation strategy to strengthen MLT's resilience.""

The distribution for Q2 will be paid on Dec 13, after the record date on Nov 2.

Units of MLT closed 2.1 per cent or S$0.03 higher at S$1.46 on Tuesday, before the results announcement."
2022-10-26,"Brokers’ Take: Analysts lower target prices on CICT, but remain positive on prospects",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/capital-markets-currencies/brokers-take-analysts-lower-target-prices-cict-remain,"ANALYSTS from UOB Kay Hian (UOBKH), DBS, and OCBC have lowered their target prices on CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT) : C38U 0%, but remain upbeat on the counter's prospects amid a rising interest rate environment.

Both DBS and OCBC maintained their ""buy"" ratings on the counter, while UOBKH upgraded its call to ""buy"".

CICT had on Friday (Oct 21) reported higher revenue and net income in a business update for Q3 FY2022.
In its report on Tuesday (Oct 25), DBS lowered its target price for the counter from S$2.17 to S$2.14 to factor in rising interest costs. Its new target price implies a price-to-net asset value ratio (P/NAV) of 1.1 times, which is close to its historical mean.

Both UOBKH and OCBC expressed some concern about CICT's increased aggregate leverage - from 40.6 per cent to 41.2 per cent - as well as its higher cost of debt, which rose to 2.5 per cent. In mitigation, however, they noted 80 per cent of CICT's borrowings are hedged to fixed interest rates.

OCBC raised its cost of equity assumption for the counter from 6.4 per cent to 6.6 per cent while lowering its terminal growth projection from 1.5 per cent to 1.25 per cent, on expectations of a mild recession in the United States in 2023.
In light of these adjusted projections, the research house reduced its fair value for CICT from S$2.42 to S$2.15.

UOBKH analyst Jonathan Koh, meanwhile, said in a Wednesday report that CICT's increases in leverage and cost of debt were ""slight"", and the Reit's (real estate investment trust) balance sheet was resilient enough to weather external uncertainties.

Noting that new office tenants will only contribute to CICT's cash flow starting January 2023, UOBKH reduced its distribution-per-unit (DPU) forecast for the counter by 3.5 per cent in 2022, and by 0.6 per cent in 2023.

The brokerage thus set a lower target price for the counter at S$2.14, down from S$2.17, giving it an ""attractive"" distribution yield of 6.7 per cent for the Reit.

Despite the cutting of target prices across the board, the research houses remained bullish on CICT's prospects. They see the Reit's retail and office assets benefiting from higher rental reversion and occupancy rates, due to the post-pandemic reopening and the relaxation of public health measures.

DBS said CICT's DPU could grow at a compounded annual rate of 6 per cent over the next two years, which would represent one of the stronger growth rates among its peers.

Shares of CICT closed 4.4 per cent or S$0.08 higher on Wednesday at S$1.90."
2022-10-26,Keppel DC Reit’s Q3 DPU up 5% to S$0.02585,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/keppel-dc-reits-q3-dpu-5-s002585,"THE manager of data centre-focused Keppel DC Reit on Wednesday (Oct 26) announced a 5 per cent increase in distribution per unit (DPU) to S$0.02585 for the third quarter ended September, from S$0.02462 in the corresponding period a year ago.
Distributable income was 9 per cent higher at S$46.9 million, from S$43.1 million in Q3 last year.
The real estate investment trust (Reit) manager attributed the increase to contributions from new acquisitions and completed asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs), as well as renewals and income escalations, among others.
Q3 gross revenue rose 1.4 per cent to S$70.3 million, while net property income (NPI) was 0.5 per cent higher at S$64.1 million.
The increase in gross revenue was partially offset by net lower contributions from some of the Singapore colocation assets, the depreciation of the euro, Australian dollar and British pound against the Singapore dollar, and the divestment of iseek Data Centre.
Keppel DC Reit's portfolio occupancy climbed 0.4 percentage point to 98.6 per cent as at Sep 30, with the weighted average lease expiry (WALE) extending to 8.7 years, from 7.6 years as at end June.
Aggregate leverage rose 220 basis points (bps) from the previous quarter to 37.5 per cent as at end September, with an average cost of debt of 2.3 per cent.
The increase in borrowings was mainly due to the financing of the acquisition of Guangdong Data Centre 2 and the premises of Guangdong Data Centre 3.
The Reit manager said that 74 per cent of its loans were hedged to fixed interest rates. It added that a 100 bps increase in interest rates would have an impact of about 2.1 per cent to Q3 DPU on a pro forma basis.
On the impact of rising electricity prices, the Keppel DC Reit manager said ""significantly above 90 per cent"" of electricity costs are passed through to its colocation clients, while its master lease clients contract electricity directly with the power suppliers.
Units of Keppel DC Reit closed 4.8 per cent or S$0.08 higher at S$1.74 on Wednesday, before the results announcement."

The DPU for H1 FY2023 held steady amid an enlarged unit base, a 27.5 per cent increase in gross revenue to S$83.2 million and a 28.2 per cent rise in net property income (NPI) to S$61.1 million. 
The rise in revenue and NPI were largely due to its acquisition of Australian supermarket and grocery chain Woolworths' headquarters, as well as rental incomes and recoveries from its Singapore properties, the manager said.
Meanwhile, the amount distributable to unitholders inched up 0.4 per cent to S$33.7 million in H1 FY2023, from S$33.6 million in the same period last year. 
Excluding the Reit's one-off reversal of rental relief provision during the pandemic, its manager said that DPU would have gone up 0.9 per cent from the adjusted DPU of S$0.0466, while the amount distributable to unitholders would have hiked 2.3 per cent. 
Overall growth was moderated by higher borrowing costs, especially to finance the acquisition of Woolworths' headquarters; the depreciation of the Australian dollar against the Singapore dollar; and an increase in the amount reserved for distribution to perpetual securities holders, said AA Reit's manager. Its property operating expenses also surged 25.8 per cent on the year to S$22.1 million from S$17.5 million, offsetting potential gains.
In an earnings call with The Business Times (BT), chief executive of the Reit's manager, Russell Ng, said he intends to capitalise on a combinaton of fixed built-in escalation and rental reversions to help AA Reit improve its overall revenue projection.

Elaborating, he said that at least 50 per cent of AA Reit's revenue is currently covered by built-in escalations averaging 3 per cent a year to combat inflation, and he intends to grow the pie of rental income covered by such a mechanism.

Rental reversions, he said, can be achieved through its multi-tenanted segment, which currently contributes 55.2 per cent of gross rental income.

""We like that combination between multi-tenancy and single user, because the other thing about multi-tenancy - when you have shorter leases, it allows you to go back to the market and have a renewal of our leases to market, so we have a mark to market,"" he said.

Ng added that AA Reit has managed to see a sustained rental uplift, particularly within the logistics and warehouse segment, amid a tightening supply of good quality buildings.

The manager, meanwhile, said Australia's industrial sector remains supported by infrastructure investment, supply chain volatility and higher online spending. 

The Reit's two business parks (Optus Centre and Woolworths' headquarters in Sydney) and one light industrial asset (Boardriders' headquarters in Gold Coast) are on triple-net leases with long lease terms ranging from 9 to 11 years, it pointed out.

Going forward, the manager added it intends to implement energy-efficient measures to alleviate rising energy costs and inflationary pressures, which are expected to add to operational expenses.

Ng told The Business Times that AA Reit is interested in the growing sustainability-linked loans market, but, given that its average loan maturity is about 3.5 years - which he calls ""fantastic"" under current market conditions - it may not be commercially viable to unravel its existing loans.
Nevertheless, he said the Reit's manager is in ""active discussions"" with a couple of lenders on the possibility of converting their existing loans to green ones, since the Reit is working on concretely reducing its carbon emissions, which would qualify it for the green loans.
As at 3.04 pm, units of AA Reit were trading up 5.2 per cent or S$0.06 at S$1.22."
2022-10-27,Mapletree Industrial Trust’s acquisition drought likely to persist amid high cost of capital,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/mapletree-industrial-trusts-acquisition-drought-likely-persist-amid-high-cost,"INVESTORS pining for inorganic growth from Mapletree Industrial Trust (Mint) : ME8U +0.46% are expected to continue to be disappointed for now, as the real estate investment trust (Reit) manager is likely to extend its acquisition drought until at least the middle of next year.

The Singapore-listed real estate investment trust (S-Reit) has not announced any acquisitions since May 2021, when it proposed the purchase of a portfolio of 29 data centres in the US for S$1.8 billion.

As at end September 2022, Mint's assets under management (AUM) stood at S$8.9 billion, with data centres in North America accounting for just over half of its portfolio value. The Reit manager had earlier guided that its long-term strategy is for two-thirds of its portfolio contribution to come from data centres.
Some of its potential acquisitions will come from the pipeline of sponsor Mapletree Investments, which owns and manages S$78.7 billion of assets across Asia-Pacific, Europe, the United Kingdom and North America as at end March.

Among others, Mint has the right of first refusal over its sponsor's 50 per cent stake in the Rosewood portfolio of US data centres.

However, in an earnings call on Thursday (Oct 27) following its Q2 results announcement after market close on Oct 26, the Reit manager said it is unlikely to pursue acquisitions such as its right of first refusal on the data centre portfolio at this time.
Top Glove’s Q4 loss widens to RM463.1 million due to impairment
""My sense is that, at least for the next six to nine months, (there is a) fairly low likelihood for us to explore this in view of the market situation,"" said Tham Kuo Wei, chief executive officer of Mint's manager.

""For this asset type, capitalisation rates remain fairly tight. So unless you get a very huge friendship discount that is out of line with the market… it will not be easy for us to execute a transaction to do an acquisition,"" he added. ""We will, of course, keep an eye on our cost of capital - both on equity and debt - to see whether there's a window for us to engage our parent a little more on this possibility.""

For the Q2 ended September, Mint reported a 3.2 per cent drop in distribution per unit (DPU) to S$0.0336, largely due to higher property operating expenses and borrowing costs.

The DPU decline came despite a 12.8 per cent increase in gross revenue to S$175.5 million and a 8.3 per cent rise in net property income to S$130.3 million on the back of contribution from the properties acquired last year.

""While we have achieved steady improvement in portfolio performance, our financial performance has been affected by headwinds from higher property operating expenses and borrowing costs,"" Tham said, warning that the cost pressures are ""expected to continue for the coming quarters"".

To mitigate the impact of rising operating and borrowing costs, the Reit manager said it plans to release a tax-exempt income of S$6.6 million - relating to distributions declared by joint ventures that had been withheld in Q4 FY2019 - over the next three quarters.

""Our focus remains on prudent cost management while exploring opportunities to improve the portfolio quality and operating performance,"" Tham said.

To help mitigate the impact of rising energy prices, the Reit manager said it has increased its service charge for its air-conditioned facilities - such as the business park and high tech buildings - by about 10 per cent from July 2022.

""That has helped us offset some of the margin pressures from utility cost increases,"" Tham said.

Amid the rising interest rate environment, the Reit manager also announced that it is continuing its distribution reinvestment plan (DRP) for Q2, giving unitholders the option to receive their distributions either in the form of units or cash or a combination of both.

""We still have funding needs for our development projects… so that would require us to get capital - whether debt or equity"" Tham said. ""But we are cognisant of the fact that (the DRP) is, on a relative basis, a less attractive means compared to a year back and also the dilution effect to the portfolio.""

""We will relook in a quarter or two whether we want to continue with the DRP programme or not, but… we're continuing with it in this quarter because we still have current needs,"" he added.

Mint's aggregate leverage ratio decreased 0.6 percentage point quarter on quarter to 37.8 per cent as at Sep 30, while its weighted average all-in funding cost jumped 40 basis points to 2.9 per cent.

To reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on distributions, the Reit manager said it has hedged about 74.2 per cent of its gross borrowings of S$2.9 billion through interest rate swaps and fixed rate borrowings.

Citi analyst Brandon Lee said Mint's Q2 results were in line with expectations, but noted the ""subdued outlook"".

""Mint has outperformed S-Reits in the year to date, but we maintain 'neutral' on valuations ground and a likely worsening outlook on acquisitions and reversions,"" Lee said in a flash note on Oct 26."
2022-10-28,MPACT dragged by higher finance costs; Hong Kong’s Festival Walk weak even as VivoCity thrives,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/mpact-dragged-higher-finance-costs-hong-kongs-festival-walk-weak-even-vivocity,"THE manager of Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust (MPACT) on Friday (Oct 28) said it does not expect a miraculous recovery for its Festival Walk retail mall in Hong Kong amid China's strict zero-Covid policy.

One of MPACT's three ""core assets"" alongside VivoCity and Mapletree Business City (MBC) in Singapore, Festival Walk was a key blemish on what was otherwise a solid set of results for the real estate investment trust (Reit).

In its first results announcement post-merger, the Reit posted a 12.5 per cent increase in distribution per unit (DPU) to S$0.0494 for the first half ended September, with gross revenue and net property income (NPI) both rising 44.9 per cent.


The growth was credited mainly to the contribution from properties acquired through the merger of Mapletree Commercial Trust (MCT) with Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust (MNACT). MCT was renamed MPACT following the completion of the merger in August.

The Reit manager also attributed the improvement in financial performance to higher contributions from VivoCity and MBC, even as Festival Walk continued to weigh on the Reit's performance.

MPACT's portfolio average rental reversion stood at a positive 1.1 per cent in the first half, with about 1.1 million square feet (sq ft) of net lettable area (NLA) renewed or re-let. Festival Walk's average rental reversion, on the other hand, was negative 11.5 per cent in H1.

Shopper traffic and tenants' sales in Festival Walk dipped in H1, down 0.7 per cent and 0.5 per cent year on year, respectively. Tenants' sales at Festival Walk are now nearly 30 per cent below pre-Covid levels.

In contrast, VivoCity clocked a 49.4 per cent year-on-year surge in shopper traffic in H1; tenants' sales there jumped 48.4 per cent to surpass pre-Covid levels.

Sharon Lim, chief executive officer of the MPACT manager, speaking at an earnings call on Friday following the release of the H1 results after the market close the day before, said: ""Festival Walk cannot just turn over miraculously from what it is overnight. I think we just have to be very realistic.""

She noted that the negative 11.5 per cent rental reversion for Festival Walk was already ""definitely a vast improvement"", having narrowed from negative 30 per cent in the previous year. ""There's still softness - there's no denial - but I would say that the traction is getting better over the months,"" she said.

The way she sees it, the recovery of Festival Walk is ""highly dependent"" on the reopening of Chinese borders. ""When borders open, my confidence level will shoot up very, very high, because Chinese shoppers, rather than foreign tourists, make up the (biggest) percentage of our shoppers,"" she said.

Meanwhile, like its Reit peers, MPACT is also expected to face cost pressures from rising interest rates.

As at end September, its aggregate leverage stood at 40.1 per cent, with a weighted average all-in cost of debt at 2.44 per cent per annum, and an average term-to-maturity of debt at three years.

Some 72.5 per cent of its S$6.95 billion of borrowings are hedged to fixed interest rates; about 88 per cent of its distributable income is either derived in or hedged to Singapore dollars.

In a flash note on Oct 27, Citi analyst Brandon Lee cut his DPU estimates for MPACT by 2.8 per cent for FY2023 and by 5.7 per cent for FY2024 due to ""higher debt cost assumption"". This implies a forecasted DPU growth of 2.3 per cent for FY2023; DPU growth is expected to stay flat in FY2024.

Citi has lowered its target price for MPACT by 11 per cent to S$1.70, from S$1.90 previously, while keeping its ""neutral"" recommendation.

""The bottom line, when we look at debt… (is that) we're in a very interesting period now,"" said MPACT's Lim.

The ""burning questions"" for most chief financial officers (CFOs) of the Reits, she said, are when they think the rising interest rates will taper off, and how long they want to lock in their loans for.

""The tenure will be a valid question for most CFOs to ponder over, as to how long they want to lock their debt,"" she said. ""I don't think any CFO has the answer today."""
2022-10-30,S-Reits rebound amid less hawkish rates expectations,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/s-reits-rebound-amid-less-hawkish-rates-expectations,"WITH growing speculation that the US Federal Reserve will slow rate hikes to half a percentage point in December, global Reits saw a stronger performance last week.

The FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index gained close to 4 per cent last week while Singapore's iEdge S-Reit Index booked its strongest week this year with 6 per cent returns.

Office Reits averaged 8 per cent returns last week, the strongest sub-segment within the broader sector.
This was followed by hospitality Reits and industrial Reits, averaging 7 per cent and 5 per cent gains, respectively.

Outperforming S-Reits for the week include Manulife US Reit : BTOU +2%, Keppel DC Reit : AJBU +0.98%, Aims Apac Reit : O5RU +0.78%, Keppel Pacific Oak US Reit : CMOU 0%, and CDL Hospitality Trusts : J85 +0.99%.
Four of the above five S-Reits have reported earnings or business updates for the latest quarter, except for Manulife US Reit which will be reporting on Nov 2.
While the sector rebounded slightly on expectations of a less hawkish rate hike, many Reit managers have noted that they are proactively managing capital in view of rising interest costs.
Manulife US Reit reported 85.7 per cent of debt pegged to fixed rates as at end June 2022.
CDL Hospitality Trusts refinanced £50 million of existing term loan facilities in Q3 2022 and noted that documentation is under way for the remaining S$193 million debt maturing towards the end of the year.
Keppel DC Reit (KDCReit) noted that its debt maturity profile is well spread out, with the bulk of debt expiring from 2026 and beyond.
It is also actively managing interest rate exposures with 74 per cent of loans hedged to fixed rates.

Similarly, Keppel Pacific Oak US Reit (Kore) noted that it has no long-term refinancing obligations till Q4 2024.

The Reit has pegged 76.8 per cent of loans to fixed rates and estimates that every 50-basis-point increase in Libor/SOFR translates to a 0.067-US-cent dip in distribution per unit (DPU) per annum.

Aims Apac Reit (AAReit), in its latest H1 FY2023 release, noted that it does not have any refinancing requirements for the rest of FY2023 and that debt expiring in FY2024 has been reduced to S$30 million, representing 3.7 per cent of total debt.

Approximately 88 per cent of the Reit's total debt has been hedged into fixed rates and every 25-basis-point increase in interest rates is expected to have a 0.08-cent DPU impact per annum.

Several Reits also addressed potential impact from rising electricity prices and inflation in their latest updates.

AAReit expects inflationary pressures and rising energy costs to increase operational expenses and noted that it will implement energy-efficient measures to alleviate these costs.

Kore intends to mitigate impact of rising costs with built-in average rental escalation at approximately 2.5 per cent per annum.

KDCReit expects minimal impact with inflationary pressures being mitigated with renewals and income escalations.

It also has fixed electricity tariffs for Singapore colocation assets for two years from January 2023 and noted that over 90 per cent of electricity costs are passed through to colocation clients while master lease clients contract electricity directly with the power suppliers."
2022-10-31,Capitaland Ascendas Reit posts 5.4% rental reversion in Q3,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/capitaland-ascendas-reit-posts-54-rental-reversion-q3,"CAPITALAND Ascendas Reit (Clar) posted a positive rental reversion of 5.4 per cent for lease renewals in Q3 ended September, down from 13.2 per cent in Q2, the manager announced in a quarterly business update on Monday (Oct 31).

It expects rental reversion for FY2022 to be in the ""positive mid-single digit range"". In the year to date, rental reversion stands at 8 per cent.

The Reit manager noted that the ""heightened risk environment"" continues to put pressure on the global outlook. ""In addition to rising interest rates and inflation, the export bans by the United States of certain advanced materials and technologies to China has added to the uncertainty and volatility in the global supply chains,"" it said.
It also warned that the ongoing Russian-Ukraine war will continue to have some ""destabilising"" effect on global markets, which may have some impact on tenants' businesses as well as on Clar's operating costs.
Clar's portfolio occupancy rose slightly to 94.5 per cent at the end of Q3, down from 94 per cent as at end-June. Overall weighted average lease expiry (WALE) stood at 3.9 years.

Occupancy in Singapore came in at 91.8 per cent for the quarter, down from 91.9 per cent as at end-June. It recorded 51.6 per cent for occupancy of investments completed in the last 12 months, down from 87.8 per cent as at end-June.
Clar also announced the acquisition of two properties in Singapore for S$296.7 million in Q3. One was the Philips APAC Centre at 622 Toa Payoh Lorong 1, a six-storey high-tech industrial property; the other property was a Grade-A five-storey ramp-up cold storage logistics at 1 Buroh Lane in Jurong.

The manager said it has implemented a higher service charge for its Singapore leases from October this year, to help navigate and mitigate rising utility and interest expenses.

In the US market, occupancy declined marginally to 94.8 per cent as at end-September, from 95.3 per cent in end-June. This was due to lower occupancies in the business space portfolio, the manager said.

In Australia, occupancy rose to 99.1 per cent from 96.6 per cent in end-June due to ""positive leasing momentum for logistics spaces"", which included 92 Sandstone Place in Brisbane, and 162 Australis Drive in Melbourne.

Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom and Europe, occupancy rose to 99.4 per cent, mainly due to full occupancy at a logistics property, Transpennine 200 in Greater Manchester.

Units of Clar closed at S$2.62 on Monday, down S$0.01 or 0.4 per cent, before the business update."
2022-11-01,"Brokers’ take: Analysts keep ‘buy’ call on Capitaland Ascendas Reit, but lower target prices",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/brokers-take-analysts-keep-buy-call-capitaland-ascendas-reit-lower,"DESPITE maintaining their ""buy"" calls, analysts have lowered their target prices for Capitaland Ascendas Reit : A17U +1.89% (Clar), citing higher financing costs and growing interest rates.

DBS Group Research lowered their target from S$3.65 to S$3.40 with a forecasted FY2022 distribution per unit (DPU) of S$0.157, assuming a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 6.4 per cent at a risk free rate of 3.5 per cent. Meanwhile, RHB lowered their target from S$3.60 to S$3.15, with a forecasted DPU of S$0.16 for the same year.

Both brokerages are expecting the Reit to face higher financing costs in the next two years, with loans of more than S$1.3 billion maturing in FY2022 and FY2023. However, they also noted that this will be mitigated by having 78 per cent of its loans hedged to fixed rates.
The implementation of higher service charges for its Singapore leases in October 2022 will also further mitigate rising utility charges and inflationary cost pressures, said RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan on Tuesday (Nov 1).

Clar's acquisitions totaling S$520 million for the year were viewed positively by analysts. Natarajan pointed to the Reit's acquisitions of a cold storage logistics facility at 1 Buroh Lane and high-tech campus Philips Apac Centre as a result of its ""relatively healthy gearing"".

Analysts from both DBS and RHB also remained optimistic about the Reit's portfolio occupancy, which has increased 2.8 per cent from a year ago, to 94.5 per cent. The Reit had on Monday posted a positive rental reversion of 5.4 per cent for lease renewals in Q3 ended September.

DBS also pointed to Clar's ""myriad of structural tailwinds"" and rejuvenation of its portfolio through asset enhancement initiatives as factors that could drive earnings and capital values higher in the longer term.

Noting Clar's projected forward yield of 6 per cent, DBS commented that valuations looked attractive at a 1.1 times price-to-book value multiple, or two standard deviations below Clar's five-year average.

""Combined with its acquisitions over the past year, we expect Clar to report a 3 per cent growth in DPU in FY2022,"" added its analysts.

Units of Clar dipped by 0.4 per cent or S$0.01 to S$2.61 as at the midday trading break on Tuesday."

Yeo is currently a director in Transit Link, a subsidiary of the Land Transport Authority, and in mainboard-listed companies Venture Corporation and Nam Lee Pressed Metal Industries. She is also a fellow of the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants and a member of the Singapore Institute of Directors.

According to the manager, Yeo has more than 30 years of experience in professional practice and finance roles in commercial organisations. She was previously a partner in Deloitte & Touche and head of its real estate practice.
Yeo has led audits of clients engaged in infrastructure projects, property development and investment and related technical services, as well as in sectors such as manufacturing, marine transportation, oil and derivative trading, hospitality, retail and channel distribution, the manager added.

Christina Tan, chief executive officer of Keppel Capital and chairman of the manager, noted Yeo's ""wealth of experience and depth of knowledge across a wide range of industries"" in the span of her career.

""She will strengthen the competencies of the board as we continue to drive the performance of Keppel DC Reit to deliver greater value for our stakeholders,"" Tan said."
2022-11-03,OUE C-Reit posts 4.4% rise in net property income in Q3,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/oue-c-reit-posts-44-rise-net-property-income-q3,"THE manager of OUE Commercial Real Estate Investment Trust (OUE C-Reit) on Thursday (Nov 3) reported a 4.4 per cent year-on-year rise in net property income in the third quarter ended Sep 30, although its amount available for distribution continued to shrink.

Net property income in Q3 rose to S$48.3 million, due mainly to lower property expenses, the manager said in an exchange filing.

The Reit's revenue increased 1.7 per cent to S$59.5 million in the quarter, compared with the same period last year.
But lower income support for OUE Downtown Office and the higher interest expense in the same quarter led to a drop in the amount available for distribution, which was 13.3 per cent lower year on year at S$26.2 million.

The Reit's commercial segment in Q3 reported 2.4 per cent year-on-year growth in revenue to S$42.6 million, as well as a 5.3 per cent year-on-year increase in net property income to S$32.7 million.

As at Sep 30, the committed occupancy of OUE C-Reit's Singapore office properties increased 2.5 percentage points on a quarterly basis to 95.4 per cent, the manager noted.
Leasing demand was however tepid in Shanghai, owing to ongoing business uncertainty and as occupiers focused on space and cost efficiencies, it said.

Q3 revenue for the hospitality segment remained at the minimum rent of S$16.9 million under the master lease arrangements of OUE C-Reit's hotel properties due to the reduced inventory, said the manager. Net property income rose 2.7 per cent year on year in the same quarter to S$15.6 million.

Han Khim Siew, chief executive of the manager, said it has taken a ""proactive capital management approach"" to stay resilient against inflation, rising interest rates and other headwinds like heightened geopolitical tensions.

""We have mitigated refinancing risk by successfully completing the early refinancing of close to S$1 billion of secured debt in August with an unsecured S$978 million sustainability-linked loan,"" said Han.

This means only 12 per cent of total debt is due for refinancing in 2023 and none in 2024.

He added that the manager further diversified funding sources in May and increased financial flexibility with the issuance of S$150 million five-year 4.2 per cent fixed-rate notes.

As at end-September, the Reit's aggregate leverage was 40.3 per cent with the weighted average cost of debt remaining stable at 3.2 per cent per annum, said the manager. It added that about 70 per cent of total debt is hedged into fixed interest rates to mitigate the impact of rising rates.

On the whole, demand for office space was largely driven by technology firms, flexible workspace operators and non-banking financial companies, said the manager.

Grade A occupancy in the central business district (CBD) grew 1.3 percentage points sequentially to 96.9 per cent, while office rents rose 2.7 per cent quarter on quarter to S$11.60 per square foot per month.

""While global macroeconomic headwinds and consolidation in the technology sector could weigh on demand and rents in 2023, core CBD Grade A office rental growth is expected to remain positive for the rest of 2022 and 2023 due to the limited supply pipeline, barring a sustained recession,"" said the manager.

As for the hospitality sector, the manager said the further easing of pandemic measures, pick-up in MICE events and continued recovery of the travel-related sectors are expected to sustain hotel demand despite inflationary pressures and the uncertain economic outlook.

""The manager will adapt its leasing strategies according to the business environment and continue to recalibrate its asset management strategy to optimise the performance of OUE C-Reit's portfolio, while remaining focused on prudent capital management,"" said the manager.

""To partially offset rising costs, the Manager will be raising service charges for the Singapore commercial portfolio from January 2023."""

It was listed in September 2021, after CapitaLand Limited restructured its business to form two distinct entities - CLI, the listed Reim business, and CapitaLand Development, the privatised property development arm.

CLI's funds business comprises five real estate investment trusts (Reits) and business trusts listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX). In September, Ascendas Reit, Ascott Residence Trust and Ascendas India Trust officially changed their names to align with the CapitaLand brand. Ascendas Reit is now known as CapitaLand Ascendas Reit : A17U +1.89%; Ascott Residence Trust is now known as CapitaLand Ascott Trust : HMN +1.13%; while Ascendas India Trust is changed to CapitaLand India Trust : CY6U 0%. All five Reits and business trusts have reported business updates for the third quarter of 2022.

CapitaLand Ascendas Reit (Clar) reported steady portfolio occupancy of 94.5 per cent and positive rental reversion of 5.4 per cent in Q3. Within the quarter, the Reit announced two acquisitions in Singapore across the industrial and logistics sub-segments, totalling purchase consideration of S$296.7 million. To help navigate and mitigate rising utility and interest expenses, Clar have implemented higher service charge for its Singapore leases from October 2022.
CapitaLand Ascott Trust (Clas) reported that its Q3 gross profit rose to 90 per cent of pre-Covid levels on a pro forma basis. Portfolio revenue per available unit (RevPAU) grew 88 per cent year on year to S$132, which is close to 87 per cent of Q3 2019 RevPAU. The trust believes that with stable income sources from master leases and longer-stay lodging representing more than half of gross profits, it is resilient against macroeconomic and recessionary headwinds. Looking ahead, Clas sees continued tailwinds from travel recovery and greater demand for accommodation, particularly from its key market - Japan - following the country's reopening to independent travellers.

CapitaLand China Trust : AU8U +1.17% (CLCT) reported 7.5 per cent year-on-year growth in net property income (NPI) for the first nine months of 2022. New-economy portfolio saw full contributions from business parks and logistics parks, which boast high occupancy of 94.3 per cent and 96.6 per cent respectively. CLCT's retail portfolio achieved its first positive rental reversion of 4.9 per cent since the start of Covid-19 while Q3 2022 shopper traffic was up 37.5 per cent and tenant sales grew 33.7 per cent quarter on quarter.

CapitaLand India Trust (Clint) reported 8 per growth year on year in Q3 NPI, driven by higher income contribution from Building Q1, Arshiya Warehouse 7 and Industrial Facility at MWC. In the year to date, Clint added 41 new tenants to its portfolio, bringing overall committed portfolio occupancy to 91 per cent, while physical park attendance improved from 5 per cent in September 2021 to 41 per cent in September 2022.
CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U +1.69% (CICT) recorded 12.7 per cent year-on-year growth in NPI for Q3. It noted that year-to-date tenants' sales for its retail portfolio have surpassed pre-Covid levels as downtown malls saw higher shopper traffic from border relaxation. On a portfolio average, tenants' sales per square feet grew 21.3 per cent year on year while shopper traffic grew 21.9 per cent over the same period. It noted that the Singapore office portfolio has also recorded positive rental reversion of 7.9 per cent, with momentum likely to be sustained on the back of limited new supply"

Weighted average lease expiry (WALE) - the mean time remaining on its leases - stood at 8.5 years when adjusted by net lettable area (NLA) and 5.5 years when adjusted by gross rental income (GRI).

The Reit's manager, however, highlighted a long WALE for its office portfolio at 12.7 years by NLA and 15.5 years by GRI. This will ensure a stable income for the Reit's unitholders, said the manager.
Meanwhile, Lendlease Reit's retail portfolio saw a 99.3 per cent occupancy in Q1 FY2023, driven by healthy leasing momentum.

""As at the period end, a positive rental reversion of approximately 1 per cent was recorded with a healthy tenant retention rate of approximately 69 per cent. Tenant sales for the first three months of FY2023 continued to surpass pre-Covid-19 average levels,"" said the manager, adding that interest in leasing the atrium space of the malls has also risen.

In the near term, the manager has plans to optimise the remaining untapped gross floor area of 10,200 square feet from the Urban Redevelopment Authority Master Plan 2019 to maximise the full potential of 313@somerset and create new value for Lendlease Reit's unitholders.
For Jem, while there is no additional plot ratio granted, the manager will look to convert spaces into leasable units to generate additional revenue.

The Reit has a gearing ratio of 39.4 per cent with gross borrowings amounting to S$1.415 billion. As at Sep 30, Lendlease Reit has undrawn debt facilities of S$172.2 million to fund its working capital, with over two-thirds of its borrowings hedged to a fixed rate.

Kelvin Chow, chief executive of the manager, said he expects the positive momentum driven by tourism recovery and a rising number of the return-to-office crowd to underpin the Reit's performance for the financial year.

""In addition, we are looking to increase non-rental revenue, unlock savings through the adoption of smart technologies to improve the efficiency of the assets and reduce non-core expenses to cushion the impact from rising interest rates and utilities costs,"" added Chow.

Units of the Reit ended Friday (Nov 4) 0.7 per cent or S$0.005 higher at S$0.70."
2022-11-08,First Reit Q3 DPU rises slightly to S$0.0066,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/first-reit-q3-dpu-rises-slightly-s00066,"THE manager of First Real Estate Investment Trust (Reit) reported on Tuesday (Nov 8) a distribution per unit (DPU) of S$0.0066 for the third quarter ended September, up slightly from the S$0.0065 in the year-ago period. 

The quarterly DPU of S$0.0066, has been unchanged since the fourth quarter of 2021, and total DPU for the first 9 months of 2022 stood at S$0.0198, up 1.5 per cent from the corresponding period a year earlier.

Rental and other income rose 39.2 per cent on year to S$80.9 million for the first nine months of 2022; net property and other income was 40.1 per cent higher, at S$79.1 million, the manager said in a business update on the Singapore Exchange.
The distributable amount for the first three quarters of 2022 was also up 23.7 per cent on year, rising to S$38.8 million from S$31.4 million.

The manager noted that the increases were largely due to the contribution from the acquisition of 12 properties in Japan in March 2022, followed by the acquisition of two more properties there in September 2022, and recognition of accounting standards for rental straight lining adjustments for Indonesia hospital properties and Singapore properties. 

The manager of First Reit aims to increase its portfolio in developed markets to more than half of its assets under management (AUM)  by 2027. Currently, more than a quarter of the Reit's AUM are in developed markets.

The Reit had 32 assets across Asia as at Sep 30, 2022, with a total AUM of S$1.2 billion. Its properties had 100 per cent committed occupancy, with a weighted average lease expiry of 12.7 years.
First Reit had total debt of S$445.4 million and a gearing ratio of 35.6 per cent as at Sep 30, 2022. Its proportion of debt on fixed rates stood at 61.7 per cent.
In terms of outlook, the manager said the economic environment remained challenging, amid factors such as tighter financial conditions, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and the lingering impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
""Despite a challenging economic environment, First Reit will continue to harness its '2.0 Growth Strategy', ride on sustainability and demographics megatrends, actively manage currency risk and interest rate risk, and prioritise the sustainability of distributions to its unit holders,"" the manager said.

2022-11-13,Industrial S-Reits see resilience despite macro challenges,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/industrial-s-reits-see-resilience-despite-macro-challenges,"IN the recent bi-annual macroeconomic review published by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), outlook for Singapore's 2022 full-year gross domestic product (GDP) growth was kept unchanged at 3 to 4 per cent with broad-based contributions from the trade-related, domestic-oriented, travel-related and modern services clusters.

However, MAS noted that Singapore's economic growth is expected to slow to a pace that is below trend next year, weighed down by key external-facing sectors such as manufacturing and financial services.

All eight of Singapore's industrial S-Reits have reported their respective Q3 financial results or business updates. Average portfolio occupancy rate across the eight S-Reits was held steady at 95.4 per cent while average gearing ratio was at 37.2 per cent.


In their releases, many echoed the weakening global outlook provided by MAS, citing challenges such as inflation, geopolitical tension and rising energy costs. However, several also noted the resilience of the industrial segment in Singapore, underpinned by long-term demand for logistics, high-value manufacturing and biomedical sectors.

Four out of the eight industrial S-Reits published financial results for the latest quarter - Aims Apac Reit : O5RU +0.78%, EC World Reit : BWCU 0%, Mapletree Industrial Trust : ME8U +0.46% and Mapletree Logistics Trust : M44U +1.94% - while the rest reported interim business updates.

Aims Apac Reit (AA Reit) reported that H1 FY2023 gross revenue and net property income (NPI) rose 27.5 per cent and 28.2 per cent year on year (yoy) respectively. This was supported by the acquisition of Australian supermarket and grocery chain Woolworths' headquarters, as well as higher rental income and recoveries from the Singapore portfolio. However, distribution per unit (DPU) for the period dipped 1.1 per cent amid an enlarged unit base. AA Reit also noted strong leasing momentum with the execution of 47 leases representing 6.7 per cent of total portfolio net lettable area (NLA) at positive rental reversion of 8.1 per cent.
EC World Reit (ECWReit) noted that Q3 FY2022 results were consistent with improving stability in China during the quarter, albeit recording a 5.4 per cent yoy dip in NPI attributable to depreciation of the renminbi and higher property expenses. In October, ECWReit proposed the divestment of Beigang and Chongxian Port Logistics. The manager commented that this divestment is timely and will allow the Reit to realise value due to the premium on agreed property values, enable it to pare down debts and provide a special distribution to unitholders.

Mapletree Industrial Trust (MIT) reported that gross revenue and NPI for Q2 FY22/23 grew 12.8 per cent and 8.3 per cent yoy to S$175.5 million and S$130.3 million respectively. The improved performance is largely contributed by the acquisition of 29 data centres in the US, partially offset by higher property operating expenses and borrowing costs.

MIT will begin the release of S$6.6 million of income in Q3 FY22/23 over three quarters. This is related to distributions declared by joint ventures that had been withheld in Q4 FY19/20 to provide MIT greater flexibility in cash management during the pandemic.

Mapletree Logistics Trust (MLT) reported that Q2 FY22/23 gross revenue and NPI increased 11.4 per cent and 10.8 per cent yoy respectively. Amount distributable to unitholders grew 15.6 per cent as the impact of weakening currencies is mitigated through the use of foreign currency forward contracts to hedge income from overseas assets.

During the period, MLT achieved a positive average rental reversion of approximately 3.5 per cent, contributed by renewal or replacement leases from across almost all of MLT's markets.

2022-11-14,Brokers’ take: Analysts cut target prices for IReit Global on leasing slowdowns,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/brokers-take-analysts-cut-target-prices-ireit-global-leasing-slowdowns,"RHB Research and DBS Group Research have lowered their target prices for IReit Global : UD1U +1.39% on an expected slowdown in the trust's leasing momentum, following the exit of a key tenant in November.

RHB maintained ""buy"" but slashed its target price for the Singapore-headquartered real estate investment trust (Reit) to S$0.63 from S$0.72, after lowering its distribution per unit (DPU) projections for FY2023 and FY2024 by 6 per cent and 2 per cent respectively.

The revised DPU projections reflect lower occupancy rates at IReit's Darmstadt Campus in Germany as well as adjusted financing cost estimates, said RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan on Monday (Nov 14). 
He noted that the sole tenant of Darmstadt Campus - which will be vacating the premises this month - contributes roughly 11 per cent of IReit's overall income. In Natarajan's view, market conditions will make backfilling the property challenging, and he has therefore assumed occupancy rates for this asset to stand at just 50 per cent and 75 per cent over 2023 and 2024.

Moreover, the analyst expects ""mostly flattish"" rental reversions for the Darmstadt asset, as asking rental rates are in line with expiring and market rates rather than the escalations of 4.2 per cent seen with IReit's other assets in the eurozone.

In the light of higher market risk premiums, Natarajan lifted the cost of equity by 60 basis points to 8.1 per cent to arrive at the lower target price of S$0.63. 
He nonetheless continues to like IReit for being ""the best positioned"" among Singapore-listed Reits (S-Reits) to shield itself against interest rate hikes. The trust has no debts maturing until November 2026, and almost all of its borrowings are hedged to fixed rates.

""Its gearing of 30.6 per cent is among the lowest for S-Reits, and provides debt headroom to pounce on good opportunities,"" said Natarajan.

DBS has also reiterated ""buy"" on the stock, but cut its target price from S$0.68 to S$0.60 on Nov 10, as IReit's upcoming lease expiries and ""lumpy"" debt expiry profile compelled the research team to choose a more conservative valuation method.

The revised target price reflects this approach by assuming a higher risk-free rate of 3.5 per cent, as well as a slight increase in financing costs. It implies a potential share price upside of more than 21 per cent.

While the DBS analysts have acknowledged that IReit's gearing is ""very healthy"" with no debt maturity until FY2026, they pointed out that 281.3 million euros (S$398.2 million) in borrowings or nearly 85 per cent of the trust's entire loan book will expire that year.

Said the analysts: ""We have taken the conservative approach of assuming a slight increase in overall financing costs, especially if new loans are required to fund any capital expenditure or working capital needs.""
The analysts also anticipate that the interest rate hikes and leasing slowdowns will put ""some downward pressure"" on IReit's portfolio revaluation in December.

The trust will see 12.4 per cent of its leases expiring in Q4 FY2022; besides the Darmstadt Campus, the Il-lumina property in Spain will see tenants vacating the space. The DBS analysts nonetheless see potential in IReit's medium-term income stability, as its portfolio has a ""relatively long"" weighted average lease expiry of 4.6 years and a high occupancy rate of 96.5 per cent.

In their view, the trust is also poised to benefit from the rental escalations in the European market. 

Units of IReit Global were trading at S$0.51, up 2 per cent or S$0.01, as at 1.41 pm."
2022-11-17,S-Reits’ Q3 results a preview of the potential horror show at the next earnings season,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/s-reits-q3-results-preview-potential-horror-show-next-earnings-season,"JUDGING by the latest results announcements for the third quarter, things are going to get a lot worse for Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) before they get better.

Higher financing costs due to interest rate hikes led to more than a third - or nine out of 24 of those S-Reits that reported substantial quarterly data - reporting a decline in distributable income to unitholders for the latest period.

For the offshore real estate investment trusts (Reits) and those with sizeable portions of their portfolios based overseas, this was exacerbated by foreign exchange woes. Several major currencies - including the Australian dollar, British pound, Chinese yuan and Japanese yen - have weakened against the Singapore dollar over the recent quarter.


Most of the S-Reits had previously disclosed sensitivity guides on the potential impact of rising interest rates on distribution per unit (DPU). But to witness the actual impact on DPU - especially on some of the bigger Reits with better capital management - was disconcerting.

Frasers Centrepoint Trust : J69U +1.44% (FCT), for example, posted a 2.8 per cent decline in distributable income for the second half, despite a 7.9 per cent increase in gross revenue and 6 per cent growth in net property income (NPI).

The Reit manager attributed the reduced overall distribution income largely to rising interest rates, with the Reit's average all-in cost of debt rising 10 basis points (bps) quarter on quarter to 2.5 per cent as at Sep 30.FCT's finance costs jumped 21.6 per cent to S$26.5 million for the six-month period, with a S$5 million increase in interest expense.

With some 21.5 per cent of FCT's total borrowings of S$1.82 billion maturing by end-September 2023, its average all-in cost of debt is guided to rise further by at least 50 basis points to hit above 3 per cent in FY2023.

This comes as the Federal Reserve in November hiked interest rates by 75 bps for the fourth consecutive time in a bid to fight rising inflation rates - marking its sixth rate hike this year.

FCT is by no means the only S-Reit to be hit by rising interest rates, nor is it the worst hit. It was merely one of only a handful of S-Reits that had reported full or half-year results in the most recent reporting period, and had therefore disclosed a full set of financial numbers.

The majority of the S-Reits were only required to provide quarterly operational updates for Q3.

Only 24 of the 40 actively traded S-Reits disclosed their distributable income information at this latest earnings season. This number included some that did not have to divulge this information, but commendably did so anyway.

This means that S-Reit investors may be in for some pain in the next reporting quarter.

Some of those Reits volunteered more information because of good corporate governance practices. Others may have been more detailed in their disclosures because they were happy with certain numbers.

The latest disclosures may, therefore, have painted a relatively rosy picture of how S-Reits have been impacted by rising interest rates.

Coupled with the fact that the full impact of the interest rate hikes has not yet been included into the S-Reits' cost of debt, and that interest rates are likely to keep rising, things could get downright ugly when the rest of the S-Reits release their results for the full year ending December at the next earnings season."
2022-11-17,"S-Reits’ Q3 results mixed as higher financing costs, currency headwinds dampen distribution growth",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/s-reits-q3-results-mixed-higher-financing-costs-currency-headwinds-dampen,"SINGAPORE-LISTED real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) have mostly reported topline growth for the third quarter. But higher interest rates and currency headwinds have taken a chunk out of distributable income to unitholders.

Of the 34 S-Reits that reported gross revenue figures for the quarter, 28 saw an improvement - mostly on the back of a global lifting of pandemic-related curbs. Among the 33 that reported net property income (NPI) data, 26 did better year on year.

The S-Reits that posted topline declines were those whose assets are mostly overseas.
For example, China-focused e-commerce logistics player EC World Reit : BWCU 0% reported a 5.5 per cent decline in gross revenue and 5.4 per cent drop in NPI for Q3.

S-Reits with malls in China also reported a drop in their topline figures.

Dasin Retail Trust : CEDU -1.75%'s revenue and NPI fell 7.8 per cent and 8.3 per cent, respectively, for the nine months to September, while Sasseur Reit : CRPU +0.76% reported a 2.1 per cent dip in income for the third quarter.
Both retail Reits pointed the finger at the temporary closure of malls and resultant reduced shopper traffic, due to sporadic Covid-19 outbreaks in parts of China.

At the other end of the world, the US office Reits also reported drops in NPI.

Prime US Reit : OXMU +2.56% posted a 6.1 per cent decline in NPI in Q3, largely due to occupancy declines, while Keppel Pacific Oak US Reit : CMOU +2.5%'s Q3 NPI was down 1.9 per cent.

Revenues and NPIs could improve in the coming quarters, as the leasing outlook was stronger across the board. Nearly all the S-Reits reported positive rental reversions for the period.

Against this seemingly positive backdrop, however, more than a third of the S-Reits saw a decline in distributable income to unitholders. This was largely due to higher financing costs, amid a surge in interest rates, as well as the relative strength of the Singapore dollar (SGD) against a number of foreign currencies.
For example, Suntec Reit : T82U +0.88% reported a 5.8 per cent decline in distributable income and 6.6 per cent drop in distribution per unit (DPU) for Q3. This was despite a 15.7 per cent and 12.1 per cent increase in gross revenue and NPI, respectively.

The Reit manager said its stronger operational performance was weighed down by interest rate and exchange rate pressures, as the Australian dollar and British pound weakened against the SGD. About a third of Suntec Reit's portfolio is located outside Singapore, with 20 per cent in Australia and 13 per cent in the United Kingdom.

Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust : BUOU +0.93% (FLCT), which has over half of its portfolio based in Australia and another 38.7 per cent in the UK and Europe, is also grappling with currency volatility.

FLCT's revenue and adjusted NPI fell 9.7 per cent and 10.6 per cent, respectively, in the H2 ended September, mainly due to the sale of Cross Street Exchange in March and weaker exchange rates over the period. Distributable income was flat for the second half, but DPU fell 2.8 per cent.

The Reit manager said higher inflation and tightening monetary policies are expected to persist over the near-term and will pose challenges, noting that both the USD and SGD have appreciated against its key operating currencies.

On the retail front, Frasers Centrepoint Trust : J69U +1.44% (FCT) saw gross revenue and NPI rise 7.9 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively, for the H2 ended September. But distributable income fell 2.8 per cent.

Both income available for distribution to unitholders and DPU were flattish in H2, helped by the release of distributable income retained in the first half.

The Reit manager said the muted DPU growth and reduced overall distribution income for H2 were ""largely"" due to rising interest rates.

It added that FCT's average all-in cost of debt, which rose 10 basis points to 2.5 per cent as at end-September, is expected to rise further to ""above 3 per cent"" in FY2023."
2022-11-20,Hospitality S-Reits ride on pent-up travel demand and the return of events in Q3 2022,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/hospitality-s-reits-ride-pent-travel-demand-and-return-events-q3-2022,"INTERNATIONAL tourist arrivals to Singapore rose for a ninth straight month in October and this is expected to continue to grow at a gradual pace in the coming months.

All hospitality trusts with Singapore assets observed significant improvements in occupancy and RevPAR (revenue per available room) in the last quarter, driven by the return of large-scale events and the Mice (meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions) industry, alongside pent-up demand for overseas travels.

CapitaLand Ascott Trust : HMN +1.69% updated that revenue and gross profit for Q3 2022 were higher year on year (yoy). Gross profit rose to approximately 90 per cent of Q3 2019 pro forma levels due to contributions from several new properties and full quarter contribution from Wildwood Lubbock, as well as stronger operating performance of the existing portfolio.


Even without these contributions, gross profit rose 70 per cent yoy. Portfolio RevPAU rose 88 per cent yoy to S$132 with Australia and USA continuing to perform at close to pre-Covid levels. The trust’s stable income portfolio, which contributes 56 per cent of Q3 2022 gross profits, recorded improvements across its master leases, longer-stay properties, and management contracts with minimum guaranteed income (MCMGI).

CDL Hospitality Trusts : J85 +0.99% updated that its net property income (NPI) for 9M 2022 improved 43.7 per cent to S$82.6 million, with the most significant contributors being Singapore and Australia properties which collectively increased by S$15.4 million yoy for Q3 2022. In Q3 2022, RevPAR for 12 hotels (out of 18) exceeded Q3 2019 levels.

In its Singapore hotels, occupancy rate has improved from 72.3 per cent in Q3 2021 to 88.1 per cent in Q3 2022, driven by the recovery of Singapore’s Mice industry and events. The trust remains positive in the outlook for demand recovery in Singapore as visitor arrivals and events continue to pick up, and it also believes there is potential for pent-up demand to take place in Japan following the reopening of borders in October 2022.

Far East Hospitality Trust : Q5T 0% recorded that its Q3 2022 gross revenue increased 2.0 per cent yoy, led by growth from the hotel segment which increased 4.7 per cent. Income available for distribution grew 12.0 per cent yoy from higher NPI and interest income.

During Q3 2022, RevPAR and average daily rate for its hotels continued to improve (101.9 per cent and 107.6 per cent yoy, respectively) and surpassing that of the first two quarters of 2022. For its services residences segment, RevPAR and average daily date grew 66.7 per cent and 32.4 per cent yoy in the quarter, respectively, achieving two consecutive quarters of growth this year.

Frasers Hospitality Trust : ACV 0% reported full year results for FY2022. Gross revenue improved 12.1 per cent yoy due to relaxed travel restrictions and higher vaccination rates. NPI and income available for distribution increased 20.7 per cent and 66.3 per cent yoy, respectively, from lower property tax expenses arising from lower assessed annual values of Singapore properties and recovery of receivables previously impaired.

The improvement across its portfolio lifted its distribution per stapled security (DPS) in FY2022 by 66.4 per cent yoy to 1.6355 cents. Improvements in RevPAR were recorded across most of its operating markets. In Singapore, RevPAR grew 75.7 per cent yoy in H2 2022 from the resumption of events and tourist arrivals."
2022-12-04,S-Reits rebound 6% in November,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/transport-logistics/s-reits-rebound-6-november,"THE iEdge S-Reit Index recovered 5.7 per cent in total returns in November, after a 5.6 per cent decline in October. It outperformed the FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index which gained 3.5 per cent during the same period.

Interest rates and economic growth in key Asian markets continued to be key drivers during the month.

On a year-to-date total return basis, S-Reits have seen a 10.9 per cent decline, against the Straits Times Index’s 9.6 per cent gain, while the FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index has seen a decline of 21.1 per cent.
Top performing sub-segments within the S-Reits sector in November were data centre, diversified and industrial S-Reits which saw average total returns of 12 per cent, 8 per cent and 4 per cent respectively.

S-Reits within the healthcare segment were the only ones which averaged negative total returns.

During the month of November, retail investors have been a key driver in the sector’s fund inflow activities, accumulating net retail inflows of S$54 million.
Institutional investors on the other hand, net sold S$95.6 million for the sector.

In terms of sub-segments, retail flows were driven by inflows seen in office (+S$31.1 million), industrial (+S$10.8 million) and healthcare S-Reits (+S$4.6 million).

Diversified (+S$12.3 million) and data centre S-Reits (+S$5.2 million) were the only sub-segments that received net institutional inflows.

Six S-Reits recorded double-digit total returns last month: Digital Core Reit : DCRU 0%(+18.1 per cent), CapitaLand China Trust : AU8U +1.17% (+16.5 per cent), Daiwa House Logistics Trust : DHLU 0% (+16.1 per cent), OUE Commercial Reit : TS0U +2.22% (+12.3 per cent), SPH Reit : SK6U +1.23% (+10.4 per cent) and CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U +2.26% (+10.1 per cent).

Digital Core Reit (DCReit) has just updated that it will proceed with the fully debt-funded acquisition of a 25 per cent interest in a freehold data centre in Frankfurt, Germany for approximately US$140 million. The transaction is expected to be distribution per unit (DPU) accretive by 2 per cent on a pro forma basis and marks Digital Core Reit’s maiden acquisition since listing in 2021.
In its latest business update, DCReit reported 9M 2022 net property income of US$53 million, 5.7 per cent above the IPO forecast.

However, distributable income came in at US$34 million, missing the forecast by 3.4 per cent.

The Reit noted that while the business is not completely immune to broader macroeconomic trends, data centre demand is durable. It believes in the strong support from its sponsor, Digital Realty, and that it can afford to be patient while waiting for an opportune time to execute its next phase of growth plans."
2022-12-05,Worst could be over for S-Reits even as analysts slash target prices,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/worst-could-be-over-s-reits-even-analysts-slash-target-prices,"ANALYSTS have slashed their target prices for Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) on higher-than-expected interest costs and foreign exchange woes. But a rebound in S-Reit prices in November has sparked hopes that the worst may be over.

Following the results for the quarter ended September, DBS Group Research cut distribution per unit (DPU) forecasts for FY2023 and FY2024 by 7 per cent as it revisited its estimates for the S-Reits.

“Based on our revised estimates, the S-Reits are now forecast to deliver a FY22-24 DPU growth of 2 per cent,” DBS analysts Derek Tan, Rachel Tan, Dale Lai and Geraldine Wong said in a recent report.
Excluding the hospitality sector, which is projected to deliver a two-year compound annual growth rate in DPU of 16 per cent through to FY2024, the rest of the S-Reits are expected to see DPU contract by 0.2 per cent annually.

“The results season was an opportunity for us to revisit our estimates for the S-Reits, given the more-than-expected rise in base rates in 2022,” the DBS analysts said.

In addition, S-Reits with foreign-based assets – especially those with majority exposure to the euro, Japanese yen and British pound – received downward revisions in estimates as the analysts updated their foreign currency assumptions to spot rates.
Target prices were also lowered by an average of 11 per cent on the slower growth assumptions.

Manulife US Reit : BTOU +4% saw the biggest cut in target price to US$0.48, down 31 per cent from US$0.70 previously.

Prices of the US office Reit, which at its third-quarter results briefing announced it is undertaking a strategic review, has fallen 44 per cent in the year to date.

In comparison, the iEdge S-Reit Index is down 16.5 per cent in the year to date, while the Straits Times Index is up 4.7 per cent.

Other research houses have also lowered their target prices on Manulife US Reit, while maintaining their “buy” calls.

RHB cut its target price by 18 per cent to US$0.64, while CGS-CIMB trimmed its target price by 12 per cent to US$0.69.

Fellow US office landlord Prime US Reit : OXMU +2.56% also suffered the brunt of the target price cuts, with DBS lowering its target price by 26 per cent to US$0.65, from US$0.88 previously.

RHB also cut its target price for Prime US Reit by 23 per cent to US$0.77, from US$1 previously.

“The counter has been oversold along with its peers and is trading close to distressed levels... amid an overly bearish outlook for the US office sub-sector,” said RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan.

Units of Prime US Reit have fallen 44 per cent in the year to date.

Another S-Reit with a big drop in its target price is UK-focused Elite Commercial Reit : MXNU 0%, whose target price was lowered by 24 per cent to £0.53, from £0.70 previously.

Units of Elite Commercial Reit are trading 25 per cent lower year-to-date.

Elite Commercial Reit was also the only S-Reit to be downgraded by DBS to “hold”, from “buy” previously.

“While Elite Commercial Reit’s fundamentals remain intact, the higher cost of debt will weigh on DPU going forward,” the research house said in a report following the Reit’s third-quarter operational update.

Other S-Reits that have had their target prices slashed by more than 20 per cent by DBS include Daiwa House Logistics Trust : DHLU 0%, Digital Core Reit : DCRU 0%, EC World Reit : BWCU 0% and ARA US Hospitality Trust : XZL 0%.
With lower-than-expected US inflation data for October fuelling a rise in S-Reit prices over the past month, however, analysts believe it could mark a possible turn in fortunes for the sector.

“US Federal Reserve chair Jeremy Powell has given clear hints of a slowdown in future rate hikes as early as December 2022,” DBS analysts said in a separate report on Dec 2.

“We believe that the slowdown and eventual pause in hikes would support the share prices for S-Reits in the first half of 2023.”

The way the analysts see it, another key catalyst could come from the softening of China’s stance on its strict zero-Covid policy.

“There is no doubt that it will be an overall positive for investor sentiment and also have positive implications on the currently disrupted supply chains and potential consumer spending,” the analysts said, noting that some sub-sectors that are poised to benefit include industrial, manufacturing, and China-focused retail plays.

“The ‘holy grail’ will come from the eventual resumption of outbound travel of China tourists, which will be a further boost to the hospitality sector in the medium term,” they added."
2022-12-08,Singapore’s other pure-play Reits trading below book could do with strategic reviews too,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/singapores-other-pure-play-reits-trading-below-book-could-do-strategic-reviews-too,"THE decision by the manager of Manulife US Reit : BTOU +4% to conduct a strategic review – just six years into its listing on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) – is a bold move.

On one hand, some in the market might take it as an admission of failure.

That the value of a real estate investment trust (Reit) – backed by a strong global sponsor, no less – should have collapsed to the extent it did suggests the Reit was not built on a sturdy foundation in the first place.
On the other hand, the manager of the US-focused office Reit should be lauded for its willingness to admit it needs a makeover – and to attempt a pivot before it is too late.

In fact, other Singapore-listed Reits (S-Reits) could do with strategic reviews too.

A look at the 10 S-Reits trading at the steepest discounts to their net asset values (NAVs) per share reveals that, like Manulife US Reit, the majority are focused on a single asset class within a single geographical location.
At the bottom of the table are shopping mall landlords Dasin Retail Trust : CEDU -1.75% and Lippo Malls Indonesia Retail Trust : D5IU 0% (LMIRT), whose assets are, respectively, in China and Indonesia.

Dasin Retail Trust is trading at a whopping 80 per cent discount to NAV, while LMIRT is trading at a 67 per cent discount.
Others on the list include US-focused hotel operator ARA US Hospitality Trust : XZL 0%, China-focused industrial Reit EC World Reit : BWCU 0%, and Manulife US Reit’s US office Reit peer Prime US Reit : OXMU +2.56%.
Among the S-Reits that are trading at the biggest discounts to book value, only two have portfolios comprising various asset classes in more than one location.
These are diversified Reits OUE Commercial Reit : TS0U +2.22%, which has properties in Singapore and China, and Cromwell European Reit : CWBU 0%, whose assets are spread across several countries in Europe.
It would appear, therefore, that the market views diversification with some favour.
This makes sense, as portfolios with mixed asset classes and geographies have the ability to provide greater balance and stability.
A diversified portfolio would mean unitholders miss out on outperformance when a particular asset class or country is on an upcycle, as pure-play Reits would be the greatest beneficiaries.
But in periods of extreme and widespread volatility – such as the market currently facing – there is significantly less uncertainty.
This is particularly true of pure-play Reits with assets that are based primarily overseas.
As one Reit analyst shared with The Business Times: “Pure-play Reits with a single asset class in a single geography may be seen as riskier. But if they are Singapore-centred, would you say the same thing?”
For Reit managers, a relook at a Reit’s longer-term strategies is not a bad thing.

“I think Reit managers should periodically undertake a strategic review of their portfolio – whether internally or with an external adviser – as the market conditions and operating environment constantly evolve and change with the passage of time,” said Morningstar analyst Xavier Lee.
“For Reit managers to maintain the performance of their Reits, they will need to constantly review their portfolio, divest non-core assets and recycle the capital into better growth opportunities,” he added.

Not all Reits need to go exactly the way Manulife US Reit has, though.

Veteran Reit investor Gabriel Yap suggested that the worst-performing Reits should do “an in-depth self-examination” of themselves and their directions. “There is no need for (formal) strategic reviews as that means paying bankers using distribution income meant for shareholders.”

Certainly, any reasonably informed Reit investor would be able to tell that some S-Reits have unsustainable strategies or business models."
2022-12-11,Healthcare S-Reits capture Japan opportunities with expanding footprint,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/healthcare-s-reits-capture-japan-opportunities-expanding-footprint,"THERE are two actively traded healthcare related S-Reits, namely ParkwayLife Reit : C2PU 0% and First Reit : AW9U 0%. Both ParkwayLife Reit (37.1 per cent of its asset value) and First Reit (22.8 per cent of its assets under management) have significant exposure to Japan nursing homes and healthcare-related properties through recent acquisitions.

With Japan being the world’s second largest healthcare market and a third of its population aged 65 and above, which is highest globally, it is no wonder that nursing homes and facilities are a growing focus for the two healthcare S-Reits.

ParkwayLife Reit acquired five nursing homes in September 2022, with three in the Hokkaido region and two in the Greater Tokyo region. All properties acquired were 11.1 to 12.2 per cent below valuation and have an overall net property yield of 5.2 to 6.5 per cent. The Reit now has 57 nursing homes in Japan worth S$872.9 million as at Dec 31, 2021 across 17 prefectures and a tenant base across 30 nursing home operators.
The properties have a long-term lease structure with weighted average lease term to expiry (Wale) of 12.4 years. Approximately 95.7 per cent of ParkwayLife Reit’s revenue from its Japan portfolio is downside-protected.

As part of First Reit’s 2.0 Growth Strategy, the Reit marked its maiden entry into Japan in March 2022 with the acquisition of 12 freehold nursing homes from its sponsor OUE Lippo Healthcare. It continued to acquire two more freehold nursing homes from third parties in September 2022. First Reit now has 14 out of its 32 Asian healthcare assets in Japan nursing homes which are operated by five independent and experienced nursing home operators.

As a result of its expanded footprint, First Reit’s rental and other income for 9M 2022 increased 39.2 per cent year on year to S$80.9 million. Its distribution per unit also increased 1.5 per cent year on year to 1.98 cents.
Its entry into Japan also increased its proportion of assets under management (AUM) from developed markets to 25.6 per cent as at Sep 30, 2022. First Reit intends to focus growth in developed markets with a target to reach over 50 per cent of AUM in these markets by 2027. Its overall portfolio has a Wale of 12.7 years, a combined AUM of S$1.2 billion as at Sep 30.

Victor Tan, chief executive officer of First Reit’s manager notes that Japan is one of the Reit’s key growth markets and its continued expansion into Japan will position the Reit for long-term growth with stability.

Generally, healthcare Reits invest in income-producing real estate primarily used for healthcare related purposes including but not limited to hospitals, medical offices, outpatient facilities and nursing facilities. As such, these Reits may be seen as a way for investors to gain exposure to the growing and resilient healthcare sector."
2022-12-15,"Brokers’ take: DBS expects S-Reits to navigate rate hikes, currency headwinds well",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/brokers-take-dbs-expects-s-reits-navigate-rate-hikes-currency-headwinds-well,"SINGAPORE-LISTED real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) have ample defences against sustained interest rate hikes until late 2023, DBS Group Research said on Thursday (Dec 15).
This comes as the research team expects Singapore’s economy to slow in 2023, resulting in more cautious business consumer sentiment.
“We believe Singapore’s real estate cycle will enter a more modest growth phase, but we still project most sectors to see market rents remaining on an uptrend in 2023,” said analysts Derek Tan and Dale Lai.
Their top picks are suburban retail Reits such as Frasers Centrepoint Trust : J69U +1.44%, Lendlease Global Commercial Reit : JYEU 0% and CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U +1.69%; as well as industrial plays including CapitaLand Ascendas Reit : A17U +2.27%, Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust : BUOU +1.87% and CapitaLand India Trust : CY6U 0%.
These Reits offer better distribution per unit (DPU) resiliency with the potential for surprise upside, DBS said.
Although the research team is expecting an overall net property income growth of about 5 per cent from FY2022 to FY2024, it projected a flatter DPU growth rate of 3 per cent.
Excluding hospitality S-Reits, DPU growth is estimated to drop 0.5 per cent, as higher refinancing rates and foreign exchange losses weigh on certain S-Reits. That being said, S-Reits, on a whole, will still have sufficient leeway due to their high fixed-rate debt ratios.
Currency risks are also well-mitigated for most S-Reits, as their managers have entered into forward hedges to smooth currency impact.
The most negatively impacted by currency risks is Daiwa House Logistics Trust : DHLU 0%, DBS noted. It said the 16 per cent depreciation in the yen against the Singapore dollar will weigh on FY2023 DPU, although the Reit’s manager has hedged most of the income at a rate higher than current spot prices.
Meanwhile, Reits such as CapitaLand India Trust have negative exposure to the rupee, and pure-play China-focused S-Reits may get hit by the year-to-date depreciation of yuan to the Singapore dollar, the research team said.
“We see a more conducive environment for S-Reits as the Federal Reserve potentially slows and ends its hikes by the first quarter of 2023,” it added."
2022-12-18,Recovery continues for S-Reits with Singapore retail assets,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/recovery-continues-s-reits-singapore-retail-assets,"SINGAPORE’S retail sales continued to rise in October 2022, though at a slower pace compared to the previous month. October’s retail sales increased 10.4 per cent year on year (yoy), extending September’s 11.3 per cent growth and marking its seventh consecutive month of double-digit yoy growth.

The estimated total retail sales value in October was S$4.0 billion, of which online retail sales made up an estimated 13.0 per cent, compared to the 13.9 per cent recorded in September. Analysts expect the growth momentum to continue into the last two months of 2022 as consumers enter the festive season and households front-load big-ticket item purchases ahead of the goods and services tax hike starting in 2023.

Listed on the Singapore Exchange are seven S-Reits which have significant exposure to Singapore-based retail assets: CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U +1.69%, Frasers Centrepoint Trust : J69U +1.44%, Lendlease Global Commercial Reit : JYEU 0%, Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust : N2IU +2.92%, SPH Reit : SK6U +0.61%, Starhill Global Reit : P40U 0% and Suntec Reit : T82U +0.88%.
The S-Reits, in their most recent business updates and financial results, continued to post strong operational recoveries in terms of shopper traffic and tenant sales. In terms of price performance, the top three performers for the quarter-to-date till Dec 15 were CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (+6.3 per cent), SPH Reit (+1.1 per cent) and Frasers Centrepoint Trust (+1.1 per cent).

CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust reported 21.3 per cent y-o-y growth in tenant sales and 21.9 per cent y-o-y growth in shopper traffic for 9M 2022. The leisure & entertainment trade category, which saw 124.4 per cent y-o-y growth, saw the strongest recovery in terms of tenant sales followed by shoes & bags at 70.3 per cent y-o-y growth.

The Reit noted that leasing activity started to pick up in Q3 2022 with demand primarily driven by food & beverage operators. For the full year FY 2022, SPH Reit’s portfolio gross revenue grew by 1.7 per cent yoy to S$281.9 million, while net property income (NPI) recovered by 3.5 per cent yoy to S$209.7 million. Its Singapore portfolio’s retail tenant sales grew 8.8 per cent yoy while footfall increased 15.9 per cent yoy. SPH Reit also announced that it will change its financial year end from Aug 31 to Dec 31.
Frasers Centrepoint Trust, which also reported full year FY2022 financial results in October, noted a 4.6 per cent y-o-y increase in gross revenue for the year and a 4.9 per cent y-o-y increase in NPI. This was lifted by stronger H2 2022 results due to an absence of rental rebates to tenants and an increase in atrium income with the resumption of atrium events from March 2022.

Its portfolio shopper traffic recovered 12.4 per cent yoy while tenant sales was up 11.3 per cent yoy and averaged 10 per cent above pre-Covid levels."
2022-12-27,"Amid high interest rates, Reits may want to forgo acquisitions for organic growth instead",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/amid-high-interest-rates-reits-may-want-forgo-acquisitions-organic-growth-instead,"PRICES of real estate investment trusts (Reits) have been battered by rising interest rates. And the acquisition growth engine has slowed substantially for many acquisitive trusts. But prospects are not all bleak for Singapore’s Reits. 

In 2021, Mapletree Industrial Trust : ME8U +1.38% (MIT) significantly scaled up its data centre presence with a US$1.32 billion portfolio acquisition of 29 data centres in the United States. To help fund this acquisition, the trust completed an S$823.3 million equity fund-raising exercise.

MIT is posting decent results: for the six months ended Sep 30, 2022, net property income and distribution per unit (DPU) rose 15.6 per cent and 0.4 per cent, respectively, from a year ago. Yet MIT, like many other Reits and business trusts, has been much less acquisitive recently.
Rising interest rates probably help explain why many Reits are slowing down on acquisition growth. Compared to the start of 2022, the three-month compounded Singapore Overnight Rate Average rose by around 290 basis points to 3.1 per cent per annum as at value date Dec 22, 2022.

The acquisition growth driver for Reits works well when borrowing costs are low and yield-driven investors have few choices. Making DPU accretive acquisitions is much easier if debt costs under 2 per cent per annum, versus over 4 per cent per annum.

Moreover, Reits are subject to borrowing limits. As such, Reits which make big acquisitions or go on acquisition sprees will likely need to raise equity. With higher interest rates, raising equity is challenging as investors are spoilt for choice.
For example, investors can currently get decent returns from risk-free Singapore dollar-denominated instruments such as fixed deposits, Singapore Savings Bonds and treasury bills. In the last six-month treasury bill issuance of 2022, the cut-off yield was at 4.28 per cent when auction closed on Dec 21.

Sponsor support

Daiwa House Logistics Trust : DHLU 0% (DHLT), which made its trading debut in late 2021, recently completed its maiden acquisition that is expected to be DPU accretive. This deal shows the pain that a Reit’s sponsor may need to bear in order to make acquisitions work in the current climate.

On Dec 8, DHLT completed buying two freehold logistics facilities – DPL Iwakuni 1 & 2 and D Project Matsuyama S – and a freehold land parcel, D Project Iruma S Land, from its sponsor, Daiwa House Industry Co Ltd (DHICL), for a total consideration of 4.68 billion yen (S$47.7 million). The properties were bought at an 11.8 per cent discount to their aggregate appraised value as at end-June. 

Financing was largely via borrowings and subscription of units by the sponsor. The subscription issue price was the higher of S$0.77 per unit – the adjusted net asset value (NAV) per unit as at end-June – or the 10-day volume-weighted average price. New units were issued to the sponsor on Dec 8 at S$0.77 per unit, 19 per cent above DHLT’s closing price that day.

Will other sponsors emulate DHICL by selling assets at discounted prices and taking up equity at a premium to the trading price, to enable listed trusts to bulk up via acquisitions?

Sponsors who cut good deals for their Reits to buy assets receive some payback when Reit managers – typically owned by the sponsors – see their management fees grow as a trust’s asset size increases. Nevertheless, with rising interest rates, expect many Reit managers to focus on refinancing debt instead of raising more debt or equity to buy assets.

Organic growth drivers

Still, higher interest rates do not mean Reits lose their relevance for investors, especially as trading prices have fallen substantially. Some Reits can bank on organic growth in 2023 and beyond.

Firstly, property asset classes such as warehouses and data centres ride on the tailwinds of strong structural drivers. The growth of e-commerce and supply chain diversification, which have been amplified by the Covid-19 pandemic, drive demand for warehouses. The war in Ukraine and heightened geopolitical tensions have upped the need for supply chain security and near-shoring of manufacturing bases.

Secondly, property asset classes such as hospitality assets will benefit from the relaxation of Covid restrictions in many places in recent months. More people are back to travelling for business and leisure, possibly with bigger budgets amid a flight to quality. With the relaxation of Covid restrictions, malls are also seeing better patronage.

Thirdly, many Reits own Singapore assets. Singapore’s strong management of the pandemic and its safe haven status in a chaotic world are boosting the Republic’s position as a business hub, which helps drive demand for office space. With Singapore’s stability driving robust demand for properties, property valuations are well-supported and the negative impact of higher interest rates is mitigated.

Fourthly, rising inflation, which is driving higher interest rates, may help some Reits that have lease agreements where rental rates adjust in line with inflation. In certain cases, higher utility costs are also borne by tenants, thus helping to insulate landlords from higher inflation.

In just over 20 years, Singapore’s Reit sector has grown substantially – Reits now account for seven of the 30 constituents of Singapore’s benchmark Straits Times Index. Facing higher interest rates, Reits have to fight hard with other instruments for the attention of yield-driven investors. 

The slowing of the acquisition growth engine weakens the investment case for Reits. Still, Singapore Reits merit serious consideration by investors as they are well regulated and tax efficient, with high levels of governance and transparency. Numerous trusts have strong sponsors and good track records.

One can enjoy a spread of about 240-310 basis points to the five-year government bond yield of around 2.8 per cent from investing in large cap Reits – CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U +1.69% and CapitaLand Ascendas Reit, : A17U +2.27% respectively – based on annualising the first-half DPU and unit prices as at Dec 23, 2022. And DPU and NAV will grow, provided organic growth drivers chug along."
2022-12-27,Mapletree Logistics Trust to sell ‘outdated’ Changi property for S$22 million,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/mapletree-logistics-trust-sell-outdated-changi-property-s22-million,"MAPLETREE Logistics Trust (MLT) has agreed to sell its 23-year-old cargo lift warehouse on 3 Changi South Lane to Nova Furnishing Holdings for S$22 million as part of its manager’s rejuvenation strategy.

The proposed sale price represents a 39.2 per cent premium to the property’s latest valuation of S$15.8 million as at Oct 1.

In a bourse filing on Tuesday (Dec 27), the real estate investment trust’s (Reit) manager said the divestment was considered since the warehouse’s specifications are “outdated”, and it is no longer suitable nor efficient to meet the requirements of today’s logistics users.
The warehouse sits on a relatively small land area – an 8,023 square metre (sq m) land site – and there is limited potential for redevelopment into a modern, ramp-up logistics facility, it added. The property has a gross floor area of 11,315 sq m.

JTC Corporation has granted in-principle approval for the transaction.

Letting go of the property will improve the Reit’s financial flexibility to pursue investment opportunities with higher yield or higher growth potential to deliver long-term sustainable value to its unitholders, it said.
MLT’s manager, meanwhile, said it plans to distribute any divestment gain from the transaction to unitholders, after taking into account all relevant costs and expenses, while the capital released may be used to fund committed investments or reduce debt.

The manager’s divestment fee, supposed to be 0.5 per cent of the sale consideration, shall be used to offset the external agent’s marketing commission, which is 1 per cent of the sale consideration, it added.

The proposed divestment is expected to complete by the fourth quarter of the Reit’s 2022/23 financial year. Following this, MLT’s portfolio will comprise 185 properties.

Units of MLT closed 1.3 per cent or S$0.02 higher at S$1.58 on Tuesday."
2022-12-28,S-Reit IPOs running scared in rising interest rate environment,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/s-reit-ipos-running-scared-rising-interest-rate-environment,"THE year 2022 marks the first year in 12 that there will be no new real estate investment trust (Reit) listings on the Singapore Exchange (SGX).

The Singapore-listed real estate investment trust (S-Reit) market has seen an average of about two new initial public offerings (IPOs) since the first listing in 2002.

Even as Singapore this year celebrated the 20th anniversary of its Reit market – the biggest in Asia outside of Japan – the absence of an IPO should come as no surprise.
The last time there were no S-Reit IPOs was in 2009, as markets were dealing with the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis.

Now, central banks are hiking interest rates to quell decades-high inflation. Their hawkish stances have many market observers predicting a recession on the horizon. Investors and management, both probably fatigued from a long-drawn battle with the Covid-19 pandemic, are now staring at another rough patch.

There was supposed to have been a number of S-Reit IPOs in 2022, according to market talk and various reports.
Mapletree Investments, for one, was said to be exploring the listing of a student housing Reit in Singapore that could raise about US$1 billion.

The Temasek-linked property developer and manager was reported earlier this year to have consulted with various banks and selected advisers for the potential IPO.

But plans for the listing of a student accommodation Reit in 2022 appear to have been shelved.

According to a source, investors in the Mapletree Global Student Accommodation Private Trust (MGSA) had recently been asked to extend the life of the fund by three years.

MGSA is a student accommodation-focused fund that owns assets in the United Kingdom and United States. It was formed in 2017 with an initial term of five years.

Mapletree declined to respond to questions from The Business Times regarding the extension of the private trust’s life or the potential student housing Reit IPO.

Another potential Reit listing that never made it to the market in 2022 was a new economy Reit by global real estate firm GLP.

GLP was reported to have begun the process to list a portfolio of logistics assets across China that cater to “new economy” industries, such as e-commerce.

Separately, Singapore-listed property giant City Developments (CDL) : C09 +1.83% had as early as June 2021 said it had made the relevant applications to various regulatory authorities for the listing of a UK-focused commercial Reit on the mainboard of the SGX.

Looking at the performance of the S-Reit market amid the uncertainty and volatility this past year, it is easy to see why sponsors are giving IPOs a miss – at least for now.

The iEdge S-Reit Index has retreated close to 17 per cent in the year to date, as rising interest rates pushed investors away from an asset class that has conventionally been seen as a “safe harbour” amid financial storms.

For comparison, the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) has climbed nearly 5 per cent over the same period.

To be fair, the S-Reits have held up reasonably well compared to its global peers. The FTSE EPRA Nareit Global Reit Index is down by over 26 per cent this year.

And, it is reasonable to expect that Reit unit prices should fall as interest rates rise. Reits are typically priced based on their yields, which would have to go up in tandem with the higher rates of lower-risk products such as government bonds.

Yet, the performance of the four most recent S-Reit IPOs – Elite Commercial Reit : MXNU +2.04% and United Hampshire US Reit : ODBU 0% in 2020, and Daiwa House Logistics Trust : DHLU 0% and Digital Core Reit : DCRU 0% in 2021 – would have done little to inspire confidence for new listings.

Prices in the units of the quartet have fallen between 20 per cent and 54 per cent in the year to date.

Investor appetite for S-Reits – and S-Reit IPOs – are unlikely to improve significantly in the short-term as interest rates continue to rise, albeit at a slower pace.

Some market watchers opine that the interest rate environment and recession woes are likely to improve in the second half of 2023.

But, with the long runway needed for the listing process, 2023 might well be another quiet year. If the bears are right, and the world heads for a global recession and even tougher market conditions, it may well take until 2024 before S-Reit investors have a new investment option."
2022-12-29,SPH Reit will rename as Paragon Reit from January 2023,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/sph-reit-will-rename-paragon-reit-january-2023,"SPH Real Estate Investment Trust (Reit) : SK6U +0.61% will be renamed to Paragon Reit as the name change will better reflect the trust’s vision and mission to capture unique opportunities in the Asia-Pacific retail landscape, the Reit manager said on Thursday (Dec 29).

The names of its security, counter and manager – along with the Reit’s logo and website – will reflect the new name with effect from 9 am on Jan 3, 2023.

The Reit manager added that the trust will be “bolstered by the deep real estate sector knowledge and strong relationships” of its sponsor, Cuscaden Peak Investments.
Cuscaden Peak Investments was formerly known as Singapore Press Holdings, and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cuscaden Peak. Cuscaden Peak is a consortium comprising tycoon Ong Beng Seng’s Hotel Properties Limited, and Temasek-linked CLA Real Estate Holdings and Mapletree.

The Reit’s existing counter code – “SK6U” – on the Singapore Exchange will remain unchanged.

It will also continue to be led by the current management team, retain its investment mandate, and manage its existing portfolio of assets.
SPH Reit’s portfolio includes its anchor asset, Paragon, along with The Clementi Mall and The Rail Mall. It has two more such facilities in Australia.

“Our change in name underscores our mission to be the landlord of choice, and to provide our unitholders with sustainable long-term growth,” said Leong Horn Kee, chairman of the Reit.

Units of SPH Reit were down 0.6 per cent or S$0.005 to S$0.895 as at 10.30 am on Thursday.

2023-01-02,China-focused S-Reits remain listless despite reopening plans,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/china-focused-s-reits-remain-listless-despite-reopening-plans,"MARKET watchers had pointed to China’s strict zero-Covid stance as a key dampener on the Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) with exposure to the world’s second largest economy.

But S-Reit investors anticipating the overhang to be lifted along with the Covid-19 curbs are likely to be disappointed. Market reaction to China’s reopening plans has, so far, been surprisingly muted.

Since Beijing announced the nationwide loosening of Covid restrictions on Dec 7, 2022, the price performance of the five China pure-play S-Reits — (CLCT), , , and (ECW) — has not been inspiring.
Of these China-focused real estate investment trusts (Reits), only one — Dasin Retail Trust — is trading higher since the initial announcement on China’s reopening.

Units of Dasin Retail Trust, whose portfolio comprises seven retail malls in China, have jumped 14 per cent or S$0.035 since Dec 6 to close at S$0.285 on Dec 30.

This comes as some relief to the property trust, which was trading at an 80 per cent discount to net asset value (NAV) earlier in the month.
Units of fellow retail mall landlord Sasseur Reit, however, retreated 3.8 per cent or S$0.03 to S$0.755 despite the positive news.

Even CLCT, the largest China-focused S-Reit with 11 retail assets, five business parks and four logistics parks in its portfolio, failed to generate any excitement among investors. Its units fell 2.6 per cent or S$0.03 to S$1.12.

Prices of the other two pure-play China S-Reits — BHG Retail Reit and ECW — were unchanged.
Meanwhile, the performance of four other S-Reits with exposure to China — (MLT), (Clas), (MPACT) and (OUE C-Reit) — has also been mixed.

Clas, whose S$7.6 billion portfolio comprises 95 lodging assets in 15 countries as at end June 2022 — including five properties in China – gained 7.1 per cent or S$0.07 to close at S$1.05.

With serviced residences, hotels, rental housing and student accommodation assets under its belt, the hospitality Reit is seen as one of the potential key beneficiaries of the reopening theme.

However, MPACT, MLT and OUE C-Reit saw their unit prices fall between 1.8 and 6.9 per cent.

MPACT’s portfolio includes two office buildings in China — Gateway Plaza in Beijing and Sandhill Plaza in Shanghai — which make up 11 per cent of its assets under management (AUM).

Yet, since the Dec 7 announcement, MPACT has lost 1.8 per cent or S$0.03 to S$1.67.

Meanwhile, China accounted for 21.1 per cent of MLT’s portfolio of S$12.9 billion worth of AUM as at Sep 30, and contributed to 22.6 per cent of the industrial S-Reit’s S$371.5 million in gross revenue for the first half, ended September 2022, of fiscal 2023.

Units in MLT are down 2.5 per cent or S$0.04 to S$1.59.

OUE C-Reit, which has exposure to China through its Lippo Plaza office building in Shanghai, is down 6.9 per cent or S$0.025 to S$0.335.

As at end September, Lippo Plaza accounted for 9.5 per cent of OUE C-Reit’s asset value and revenue contribution."
2023-01-03,"Singapore’s market is seen as boring, but here’s my case for it",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/singapores-market-seen-boring-heres-my-case-it,"LAST year was, to put it mildly, a roller coaster for global markets. The Russia-Ukraine war, inflation and interest rate hikes were just some of the incidents that contributed to the volatility.

Several major global indices experienced more than double-digit losses in their closing prices. The US S&P 500, the China CSI 300 and the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index fell 19.5 per cent, 21.7 per cent and 15.5 per cent, respectively. The S&P 500 even experienced high-frequency intraday volatility, with swings of over 1 per cent for 87 per cent of trading days in 2022. A similar situation was also observed in the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which fell by 3.1 per cent in December 2022.

Bucking the trend was Singapore’s Straits Times Index (STI), which outperformed most of the global indices and had a positive gain of 4.1 per cent. The Singapore market has proven to be a haven in these volatile times.


The value of value-based stocks
The STI is built on value stocks. For the uninitiated, this means it takes time for their prices to go up. Consequently, many deem them boring. The spotlight often lands on growth stocks. With their high price-to-earnings ratios and low (or no) dividend payments, these naturally appear more interesting to those seeking rapid price appreciations.

But the environment in the past year has not been right for growth stocks, especially since they tend to be highly leveraged. As we have seen, higher interest rates have a negative impact on these stocks – and thus the indices that track them. The S&P 500, for instance, is notoriously tech-heavy, with the tech sector accounting for more than a quarter of the index. The sector – and by proxy the S&P 500 – suffered a bruising year. Recession fears are not making 2023 any brighter for the sector now.

The STI, on the other hand, comprises largely banks, which account for 44 per cent of the index. The rest of the index is made up of telcos, industrials and real estate investment trusts (Reits). Reits make up 22 per cent of the index, and industrials 10.1 per cent. The index houses 30 of Singapore’s largest companies. These stocks are defensive in nature, offering consistent dividends and stable earnings. They might be dull, but they can potentially offer greater levels of defence – and there is value in that, especially during volatile times.
Singapore is the largest Reit market in Asia ex-Japan, with a total market capitalisation of S$110 billion. Reits are classified as value stocks, with a requisite to distribute at least 90 per cent of their net earnings to unitholders.

Reits, like tech stocks, are a highly leveraged asset class and have not been spared the pain of interest rate hikes. The iEdge S-Reit Index, which tracks the performances of Singapore Reits, suffered an unusually huge loss of 24.3 per cent from April to October 2022. There are, however, signs that the US Federal Reserve may slow the pace of interest rate hikes in the coming year. This may be a positive sign for Reits – and, by extension, the STI, since Reits make up a huge proportion of the index. Prior to 2022, Reits performed relatively well. They generated 6 per cent in total returns in 2021, which may make them appealing to investors seeking steady returns.

The Singapore factor
The wider stability of Singapore has also helped the market post growth in volatile times.

Stock market trends are influenced by geopolitical tensions. Strained relations between the US and China in August 2022 led to the S&P 500 dropping 0.67 per cent, while the Nasdaq shed 0.16 per cent.

Singapore, being politically neutral and located strategically for business flows, will continue to offer investment opportunities and access to a wealthy clientele based in neighbouring countries.

Its strong regulatory system affords such clients the assurance that they can grow their wealth in a safe jurisdiction. In fact, Singapore’s advanced business infrastructure has attracted many to establish family offices here or expand their client base in the region. Singapore’s assets under management (AUM) grew 17 per cent in 2020, outpacing global AUM growth of 11 per cent. There were 700 family offices in Singapore at the end of 2021, up from 400 at the end of 2020, based on the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s estimates.

A looming recession and ongoing geopolitical tensions are some of the issues investors will have to grapple with this year. Amid these uncertainties, the Singapore market shines through and is not to be dismissed. With sound policies, strategic decision-making and a rigorous regulatory system, Singapore is well-equipped to weather the storms that come its way.

Singapore has the makings of a boring market. If boring offers peace of mind and potential growth, however, then why not consider it?"
2023-01-06,Hospitality Reits to continue leading the way on return of China tourist dollar,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/hospitality-reits-continue-leading-way-return-china-tourist-dollar,"INVESTORS counting on a recovery in the real estate investment trust (Reit) sector should look to the hospitality space to continue leading the way this year, analysts said. Although Singapore-listed Reits should post some kind of recovery, it will not be broad based.

The Singapore Reit sector was among the worst-performing sectors of the market in 2022.

As the year progressed, Covid-19 pandemic woes started to ease in most parts of the world. This should have been good news for Reits as offices, malls and hotels filled up. Investor appetite for Reits quickly waned, however, as central banks hiked interest rates to stave off decades-high inflation.
The result was one of the worst sell-offs in the 20-year history of Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits). Higher interest rates meant many investors were able to find high returns in safer plays such as government-backed bonds and treasury bills.

The iEdge S-Reit Index fell 16.4 per cent in the year and generated a total return of -11.9 per cent including distributions. For comparison, the Straits Times Index (STI) rose 4.1 per cent and generated a total return of 8.4 per cent.

Against this backdrop, only five of the 40 actively traded S-Reits – an asset class traditionally favoured by investors for its resilience and yields – managed to generate positive total returns.
More than half of these best-performing S-Reits with positive total returns are in the hospitality sector, as the reopening theme provided some relief.

Far East Hospitality Trust : Q5T 0% (FEHT), CDL Hospitality Trusts : J85 +0.99% (CDLHT) and CapitaLand Ascott Trust : HMN +2.26% (Clas) topped the chart, marching to total returns of between 6.7 per cent and 11.3 per cent in the year. The trio were also the only S-Reits to see their unit prices close off the year higher than at the beginning of 2022.

Analysts said the hospitality segment is likely to maintain its momentum this year.

“A rebound in tourism has helped hotel RevPARs (revenue per available room) to surge past the pre-pandemic levels. In fact, average room rates have risen to decade-high levels,” said Maybank analysts led by Thilan Wickramasinghe.

“Monthly visitor arrivals are about half of the pre-pandemic level; but longer periods of stay, inelastic demand and, perhaps, better yield management are boosting sector fortunes,” the analysts added.

“All this is happening in the absence of China demand, which will further boost the sector outlook.”

The way DBS analysts Geraldine Wong and Derek Tan see it, the “phenomenal recovery” of the hospitality sector in 2022 was also supported by domestic staycation demand and the return of MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions) events.

“We observe that room rates were in the range of close to S$1,000 to S$2,500 per night over the Formula 1 weekend, and we believe that we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg for the MICE-led recovery,” they said, adding that Singapore hotel room rates are likely to remain “sky high” in 2023.

In addition to stronger recovery in MICE activity this year, Wong and Tan said other drivers include the return of corporate travellers with deeper pockets, longer lengths of stay for inbound tourists, and China’s reopening – especially from the second half of 2023.

At the same time, they said, supply remains generally muted.
Foreign S-Reits decline
The two other S-Reits that managed to eke out positive total returns were Sabana Industrial Reit : M1GU -1.28% and CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U +1.69% (CICT).

Excepting Clas, all five of the best-performing S-Reits have the majority of their assets based in Singapore.

S-Reits with purely foreign-based assets were among the worst performers.

The US-focused S-Reits dominated the bottom of the table, as the double whammy of rising interest rates and a potential recession in 2023 shook investor confidence.

The US office Reits suffered the brunt of the sell-off, as Manulife US Reit : BTOU +6%, Keppel Pacific Oak US Reit : CMOU +5% and Prime US Reit : OXMU +2.56% grappled with the reluctance of employees in the US to return to the workplace post-Covid.

Units in the trio of US office S-Reits fell between 42.5 per cent and 55.2 per cent in 2022, with negative total returns of between 37.9 per cent and 52.9 per cent.

It was also a bad year for data centre S-Reits.

US-focused Digital Core Reit : DCRU 0% – the newest member of the S-Reit market, making its trading debut in December 2021 – saw its units sink 52.6 per cent, resulting in a negative total return of 51.3 per cent.

Keppel DC Reit : AJBU +1.47%, which has just under half of its assets under management based outside of Singapore, fell 28.3 per cent and saw a negative total return of 25.3 per cent for the year.

Another two US-focused Reits – United Hampshire US Reit : ODBU 0% and ARA US Hospitality Trust : XZL 0% – were also among the biggest losers in 2022.

Retail-focused United Hampshire US Reit produced total returns of negative 25.1 per cent, while ARA US Hospitality Trust saw total returns of negative 27.4 per cent.

Improving outlook
Going into 2023, market watchers say ongoing downside risks to consensus estimates are likely to weigh on S-Reit performance in the near term.

They note that S-Reits are expected to report declines in distributions per unit (DPUs) in 2023 and 2024, due to the impact of macroeconomic headwinds.

Nevertheless, some see a “tactical opportunity” ahead when the Federal Reserve pauses its interest rate hikes.

“Historically, when the Fed pauses, S-Reits outperform the STI and Singapore banks,” said JPMorgan analysts Mervin Song, Terence Khi and Cusson Leung.

“During 2006-2007 when interest rate hikes ceased, S-Reits rallied 48.9 per cent versus the 26.9 per cent for Singapore banks and the 45.1 per cent for the STI. Meanwhile, over 2018-2019, S-Reits rose 14.9 per cent compared to 8.1 per cent and 8.4 per cent jumps in the Singapore banks and STI,” they added.

Agreeing, RHB analyst Shekhar Jaiswal said: “We believe the coming to an end of the interest rate upcycle, our bullish expectations of GDP growth in 2023, and the belief in a strong rebound in economic activity, especially in the second half of 2023, should make investors revisit the Singapore Reits sector, which delivered a dismal performance in 2022.”

The JPMorgan analysts say CapitaLand Ascendas Reit : A17U +2.65% (Clar), CICT, Keppel DC Reit and the hospitality S-Reits are likely to be the most resilient, “owing to prior acquisitions and completion of developments or asset enhancement initiatives, as well as continued travel recovery, translating into stable or increasing DPU”."
2023-01-06,Challenges and opportunities for hospitality Reits in the post-Covid race,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/property/challenges-and-opportunities-hospitality-reits-post-covid-race,"AT the height of the pandemic, countries worldwide closed their borders to stem contagion, bringing tourism and travel to a halt. The shutdowns hit hotel and lodging operators the hardest, leaving them with no choice but to redesign their business models and fast-track digitalisation.

More than two years on, the pandemic is transiting into an endemic phase, with a baseline number of people constantly affected by the disease.

The revival of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Reits) specialising in hospitality is closely linked to recovery in tourism and business travel. Reits with shopping centre assets in the Orchard Road belt are also impacted as their revenues depend highly on tourist spending.
The post-Covid rebound in travel
In Singapore, visitor arrivals surged by leaps and bounds as most countries fully reopened their borders. As of October 2022, more than 800,000 visitors have entered the country, increasing by more than 3,000 per cent year-on-year from the all-time low in 2021. Yet, the number of visitor arrivals is still not even 50 per cent of the peak recorded pre-pandemic.

Visitors from South-east Asian countries, especially Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, and those from India and Australia make up most of the visitors thus far. China’s recent relaxation of its Zero-Covid policy is expected to lead to surges in Chinese tourists in Singapore and elsewhere.
As of September 2022, the average occupancy rate for local hotels has recovered to 83 per cent, painting an optimistic and rosy picture of the hotel industry in Singapore. The hotel room rate per night exceeded the rate hotels charged in all segments before the pandemic. Revenue per room (RevPAR), an indicator of hotel room yield, also outperformed the pre-pandemic level in 2019.
The rebound comes mainly from two sources. First, revenge travel has been unleashed, sending tourists flooding out on long-awaited holidays and locals streaming into staycations.

Second, the resumption of high-impact events, including the Formula One (F1) race in Singapore, has attracted business cum leisure (b-leisure) travellers back to the island.

Given its metropolitan city nature, Singapore is not a natural resort destination, and the government’s substantial investments in building up meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions (MICE) infrastructure has borne fruit.

The steady inflow of companies moving their regional headquarters to Singapore also pulls in demand from longer-term business visitors. The higher demand, mostly seen in the luxury and business segments, has not spilled over to the low and budget hotel segment.

In the Q3 2022 real estate sentiment survey conducted by the NUS Institute of Real Estate and Urban Studies (IREUS), the outlook of the hotel sector stood out with the highest positive balance of 85 per cent, reflecting that more respondents indicated positive than negative sentiment on the industry sector.

Absorbing the Covid impact 
The business models of hospitality Reits are broadly divided into two types. The first type has a geographically diversified portfolio of hotel and lodging properties, such as CapitaLand Ascott Trust, CDL Hospitality Trust, and Fraser Hospitality Trust. CapitaLand Ascott Residences underwent a corporate restructuring exercise just before the Covid outbreak in 2019, merging the hotel assets of Ascendas Hospitality Trust into a single portfolio.

The second type focuses on real estate business in one market, such as Far East Hospitality Trust in Singapore and ARA US Hospitality Trust in the US.

OUE Commercial Trust, after the merger with OUE Hospitality Trust in 2019, integrated two hotels in Singapore, Crowne Plaza Changi Airport and Hilton Singapore Orchard, into a commercial real estate portfolio, and hence, has become a diversified Reit.

Hospitality Reits that invest and manage mostly hotel properties, locally and overseas, experienced declines in stock prices and dividend yields during the pandemic. These Reits weathered a rough patch, and their assets were significantly undervalued during the Covid period. The average price-to-book value ratio of the hospitality trusts was 0.72 as of November 2022.

Frasers Property, the sponsor, attempted to privatise Frasers Hospitality Trust (FHT) by acquiring all issued stapled units, but the offer was rejected by the minority unitholders in 2022.

Barring further black-swan events, the sector is on track back to business as usual. Some Reits bit the bullet using the Covid slack period to reposition and improve their properties. These Reits are now more ready to ride the recovery wave.

In March 2020, OUE Commercial rebranded its Mandarin Orchard to Hilton Singapore Orchard and undertook a major asset enhancement initiative to refurbish hotel rooms during the pandemic. When it reopened in 2022, the refurbished hotel, which is integrated with the adjacent retail mall at Mandarin Gallery, could tap into returning demand from business and high-end leisure travellers who prefer to stay near the prime Orchard Road shopping belt.

CapitaLand Ascott Trust used the Covid period to further consolidate portfolios post-merger and expand through new yield-accretive acquisitions of around S$318 million to strengthen their present key markets in Australia, France, Japan, US, and Vietnam.
Embedding sustainability into the business model  
While hospitality Reits are poised to gain from the recovery in travel and tourism, pressure is mounting on them to embed a philosophy of sustainability into their business DNA.

For hotel operators, this starts with tackling the wastage and overconsumption of energy and water resources that are prevalent in the sector. Smart and energy-efficient technologies could save operating costs; a more proactive approach is also helpful to nudge users to reduce energy consumption. Simple steps – such as providing refillable containers instead of single-use toiletries, providing filtered water instead of bottled drinking water, and encouraging guests not to replace bed linens and towels – can go a long way.

Hospitality Reits that ignore their environmental and social responsibilities could end up on the wrong side of investors’ books and face being sidelined.

In the recent December review of the Dow Jones Sustainability World (DJSW) Index, which represents the cream of the crop in sustainability, sustainability champion City Developments Ltd (CDL) was dropped from the index. The misalignment of CDL’s hotel arm, Millennial and Copthorne Hotels (M&C), in keeping pace with the sustainability strategy of the parent company, may have dragged down its overall assessment, causing the surprise omission of CDL from the DJSW.

Another local firm, Keppel Corporation, was added to the index.

The lifting of travel restrictions has helped revive many countries’ tourism cycle, though recovery has been uneven.

The hospitality and lodging industry should not let its guard down. Reits need to be agile and resilient in dealing with future shocks. And pandemic or no, one immediate challenge that cannot be ignored is to infuse more green and sustainability into the tourism and hospitality industry."
2023-01-08,Solid fundamentals in S-Reits despite challenging 2022,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/solid-fundamentals-s-reits-despite-challenging-2022,"THE year 2022 was a challenging one for the global Reits sector, with a rising interest rate environment and declining global growth.

During the year, the iEdge S-Reit Index declined 16 per cent in price returns, with dividends boosting its total returns to -12 per cent. Comparatively, the FTSE Epra Nareit Global Reits Index declined close to 25 per cent in price returns.

Despite headwinds over the past year, S-Reits reported solid and resilient fundamentals alongside the continued reopening of economies and the return of global travel. Hospitality Reits benefited significantly in 2022 with the rise in international tourist travels and was the sub-industry that saw the strongest performance for the year.
All hospitality trusts with Singapore assets recorded significant improvements in occupancy and RevPAR in H2 2022, benefiting from pent-up demand for overseas travels.

Retail Reits recorded marked recovery in shopper traffic footprint, stronger leasing activity and tenant sales with some even exceeding pre-Covid levels. In particular, consumer and leisure activities picked up in H2 2022 with the return of large-scale events and Mice activities. Office Reits also saw growth in occupancy rates and rental reversions while industrial Reits noted continued resiliency despite macro challenges.

Retail investors continued to be a key driver in S-Reits’ fund flow activities in 2022, accumulating net retail inflows of S$1.53 billion, while institutional investors saw net outflows of S$1.28 billion. S-Reits continued to be active in asset acquisitions throughout 2022, with total purchase considerations exceeding S$6 billion. Some of these acquisitions include maiden acquisitions and forays into new markets.
Daiwa House Logistics Trust : DHLU 0% and Digital Core Reit : DCRU 0%, both listed in 2021, announced maiden acquisitions in Japan logistics facilities and European data centre facilities respectively, with both expected to be DPU accretive. ParkwayLife Reit : C2PU -0.27% and First Reit : AW9U 0% continued to expand their healthcare focus in Japan nursing homes through portfolio expansions and acquisitions."
2023-01-10,Brokers’ take: RHB downgrades Suntec Reit to ‘neutral’ as technology sector slows,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/brokers-take-rhb-downgrades-suntec-reit-neutral-technology-sector-slows,"RHB Research downgraded its call on Suntec Real Estate Investment Trust (Reit) : T82U +0.88% to “neutral” from “buy” as it expects the Reit to be impacted by slowing growth and rising rates in the technology sector.

The research house slashed its target price from S$1.70 to S$1.47 after lowering FY2023 to FY2024 distribution per unit estimates by 12 per cent, upon factoring in adjusted occupancy and rental growth, higher financing costs, and assuming higher fees in cash.

On Tuesday (Jan 10), analyst Vijay Natarajan noted that while the Reit’s valuation remains “inexpensive” at about a 35 per cent discount to its book value, he sees limited catalysts ahead. 
While the analyst observed a slowdown in office demand drivers, he said Suntec City Mall’s performance should remain “relatively steady” with the convention segment expected to rebound strongly in FY2023.

Natarajan anticipates divestments in the near term to lower Suntec Reit’s gearing, while helping to manage interest cost pressures. In his view, the Reit’s gearing of 43.1 per cent is on the high side versus peers and has been a key investor concern.

Despite a weaker UK economic outlook, Natarajan expects negative impacts on the Reit’s overseas portfolio to be partially offset by its Singapore assets, which have seen strong operational improvements. Overseas assets could also be mitigated by long leases with no significant lease expiries or breaks until 2025, he added. 
Similarly, for its Australian assets, the Reit has already secured lease commitments for more than half of 2023 expiring leases.

Natarajan also noted that the valuation of the Reit’s portfolio is unlikely to experience significant reductions as at end-2023, with the gearing ratio to be maintained below 45 per cent.

There is potential for Suntec Reit to divest assets in Australia or pare down its stake in Singapore to lower debt, he added.

“On the foreign exchange (FX) front, it has hedged 61 per cent of its overseas derived income, thereby limiting FX impact.”

Units in Suntec Reit traded at S$1.34, down 2.2 per cent or S$0.03, as at 1 pm on Tuesday."
2022-11-27,Singapore-based office S-Reits see growth in occupancy and rent reversions,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/singapore-based-office-s-reits-see-growth-occupancy-and-rent-reversions,"ACCORDING to JLL, Singapore office rents in Q3 2022 have reached a near 14-year high, exceeding the pre-pandemic peak. CBD Grade A office rents have taken just 18 months to recover the grounds lost due to Covid-19.

S-Reits with Singapore based office assets reported growth in rental reversions and improvements in occupancy rates.

CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U +1.69% (CICT) reported higher Q3 2022 gross revenue and net property income (NPI) of 29.6 per cent and 27.7 per cent year on year (yoy) respectively for its office portfolio.
Its Singapore offices recorded a 7.9 per cent growth in rent reversion in 9M 2022 while portfolio occupancy increased from 92.9 per cent in Q2 2022 to the current 96 per cent.

CICT guided that the gap between actual and committed occupancies in four of its properties (Asia Square Tower 2, Six Battery Road, CapitaSpring, and Capital Tower) is expected to narrow by Q2 2023 and lift distributable income.

Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust’s : N2IU +2.19% (MPACT) Mapletree Business City recorded yoy growth in both gross revenue and NPI in H1FY23.
Committed occupancy has also improved marginally to 98.4 per cent.

Together with Vivocity, both assets contribute approximately 63 per cent of the Reit’s gross revenue and NPI, underscoring their status as crown jewels of MPACT.

Suntec Reit’s : T82U +0.88% Singapore office portfolio continued to strengthen as NPI and joint venture income increased by 3.8 per cent and 7.2 per cent yoy respectively in Q3 2022, driven by higher occupancy and rent at Suntec City Office, One Raffles Quay and MBFC Properties.

Committed occupancy remained strong at 99.4 per cent, above the core CBD occupancy of 94.8 per cent.

The Reit also recorded 17 quarters of positive rent reversion in its Singapore offices and an increase of 5.7 per cent in 9M 2022.

Suntec Reit expects revenue contribution from this segment to strengthen further, underpinned by the tight office supply.

Keppel Reit’s : K71U +1.2% 9M 2022 distributable income rose 3.4 per cent yoy, driven by the acquisition of Keppel Bay Tower.

Committed occupancy increased to 96.8 per cent and average signing rent for Singapore office leases continued to rise to S$11.47 per square foot per month (psf pm).

To celebrate its 20th anniversary in 2026, Keppel Reit will distribute S$100 million over the next five years as an anniversary distribution to unitholders.

OUE Commercial Reit : TS0U +2.22% reported that it achieved positive rental reversions and increased committed occupancy for all Singapore office properties in Q3 2022. Rental reversions ranged from 1.6 per cent to 9.2 per cent.

The Reit expects core CBD Grade A office rental growth to remain positive for the rest of 2022 and 2023 due to limited supply, barring a sustained recession.

Lendlease Global Commercial Reit reported that office rental escalation increased approximately 4 per cent in Q1 FY23, and its Jem mall continued to be well-placed to tap the upcoming transformation of Jurong Gateway.

Its Grade A office building is leased to the Ministry of National Development till 2044 with a rental review every five years."
2023-01-16,S-Reits may come to rue missing out on Mercatus portfolio sale,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/s-reits-may-come-rue-missing-out-mercatus-portfolio-sale,"SINGAPORE’S real estate investment trust (Reit) managers have been talking up the outlook for the retail sector in recent months.

Frasers Centrepoint Trust : J69U +1.44% (FCT), the city-state’s leading pure-play suburban retail Reit, said in its latest results presentation that it saw broad-based improvement in its operating performance for the full year ended September 2022.

For FY2022, FCT reported higher revenue, net property income (NPI) and distribution per unit (DPU). The improvement came on the back of a rise in shopper traffic and tenants’ sales, positive rental reversion and higher portfolio occupancy, the Reit’s manager said.
CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U +1.69% (CICT) – the largest Singapore-listed real estate investment trust (S-Reit) with a market capitalisation of S$13.5 billion as at Jan 12 – cited data showing positive trends in rents at both suburban and Orchard Road malls as well as Singapore retail sales performance.

The diversified Reit, whose portfolio includes a mix of suburban and downtown malls in Singapore, also pointed to data showing a slowdown in upcoming retail supply in Singapore.

According to CBRE Singapore, Singapore would add just 0.4 million square feet (sq ft) of retail space annually from 2022 to 2025. This is half of the 0.8 million sq ft of retail supply added each year in the preceding five years since 2017.Diversified S-Reit peer Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust : N2IU +2.19% (MPACT) made a similar observation.

Citing Colliers data, the Reit manager said about 1.23 million sq ft of Singapore retail space is expected to be delivered from 2022 to 2024. This translates to an average of 412,000 sq ft per year, lower than the past five-year annual average of 715,000 sq ft, it added.

“Consequently, the limited upcoming supply should support improvements in occupancy levels and rents and retail absorption is expected to recover,” the MPACT manager said in its results presentation for the first half ended September 2022.

MPACT’s exposure to the Singapore retail sector is headlined by VivoCity, Singapore’s largest shopping mall with a net lettable area (NLA) of 1.1 million sq ft.

Missing out on a steal
With limited upcoming supply and a professed confidence in the resilience and outlook of retail assets – especially those in suburban areas – the S-Reits ought to have been eager buyers when a portfolio of quality shopping malls in the heartlands recently became available.

The winning bidder for the retail properties of NTUC unit Mercatus Co-operative, however, ended up being a Hong Kong-listed player that until now had no presence in Singapore.

To be fair, the S-Reits found themselves up against a juggernaut in the form of Link Reit – the largest Reit in Asia with a market cap of HK$130.8 billion (S$22.1 billion) as at Jan 12, and HK$246 billion in total portfolio value.

Mercatus was initially reported to have bundled four of its retail properties in Singapore for sale, with a price expectation of S$4 billion.

The retail assets were Jurong Point; AMK Hub; Mercatus’ 50 per cent stake in Nex; and Swing By @ Thomson Plaza, which occupies Levels 1 and 3 of Thomson Plaza.

The portfolio of retail assets for sale was later trimmed, reportedly to make the hefty price tag more palatable to potential buyers.

Link Reit eventually won the race to acquire two of these properties – Jurong Point and Swing By @ Thomson Plaza – for S$2.16 billion.

This could be seen as a steal for Link Reit.

The acquisition price is 6.1 per cent lower than the appraised value of S$2.3 billion for the two properties as at Dec 28, 2022.

Based on annualised net property income for the two assets for January to October 2022, the transaction will represent an NPI yield of 4.9 per cent for Link Reit, according to Citi analyst Ken Yeung.

The deal is also expected to be DPU accretive.

As part of the transaction, Link Reit would also enter into a 10-year asset and property management service agreement with Mercatus for AMK Hub.

Mercatus will continue to own AMK Hub, which will be managed by Link Reit. This will result in asset-light recurring income for the Reit.

Losing out
CICT, part of Singapore-based CapitaLand Investment : 9CI +1.97%, was said to have been one of the frontrunners in the bid for Mercatus’ portfolio, alongside Link Reit.

Frasers Property : TQ5 0%, which is part of Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi’s group, was also reported to have been in the fray. Frasers Property is also the sponsor of FCT.

Mapletree Investment’s MPACT was apparently not among the parties interested in the assets. But perhaps, it should have been.

One of the reasons the S-Reits might have been apprehensive could be the size of the deal.

Even after it had been trimmed down, the price tag of over S$2 billion could be seen as a major stumbling block.

As at end-September 2022, CICT’s aggregate leverage stood at 41.2 per cent. Gearing for FCT and MPACT stood at 33 per cent and 40.1 per cent, respectively.

The leverage ratios of all three S-Reits are some ways away from the regulatory limit of 50 per cent.

But S-Reit managers have generally been prudent, preferring to keep their leverage ratios at below 40 per cent. The additional debt to fund the acquisition may have been more than they were willing to stomach.

In comparison, the transaction will bump Link Reit’s aggregate leverage to just 27.1 per cent from 23.2 per cent.

The Reit manager said the acquisition will be fully funded through its internal cash resources and debt facilities.

The S-Reits, however, would likely have had to raise equity to fund the purchase. And amid volatile equity markets and investor appetite for S-Reits dented by interest rate fears, an equity fundraising exercise would have been challenging.

Even so, Singapore’s Reits and real estate players missed out on an interesting opportunity in their own backyard."
2023-01-18,"All eyes on asset valuations, capital management strategies as S-Reits gear up for FY results",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/all-eyes-asset-valuations-capital-management-strategies-s-reits-gear-fy-results,"THERE is an air of expectancy as the Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) start to release their financial results for the period ending December 2022 from this week.

On one hand, China’s reopening has sparked hopes of a Reit revival. The country’s lifting of Covid-19 curbs is expected to be a welcome shot in the arm for the sector, after a dismal 2022 that saw one of the worst sell-offs in the 20-year history of S-Reits.

However, the uncertainty of higher-for-longer interest rates will keep investor attention firmly fixed on how the Reit managers wrestle with challenges on the capital management front.
Some of the key metrics that market watchers – such as Maybank analyst Krishna Guha – will be paying special attention to in the upcoming result announcements include the Reits’ “asset valuations, aggregate leverage and funding costs”.

“In terms of valuation, the focus will be more on offshore commercial assets and any impact of recent transactions in the Singapore commercial space,” Guha said.

The magnitude of the impact of declining asset valuations became apparent to S-Reit investors at the end of 2022, when Manulife US Reit : BTOU +6% disclosed that the real estate valuation of its US office portfolio had fallen by 10.9 per cent.
This led to a surge in its aggregate leverage to 49 per cent – just slightly under the regulatory limit of 50 per cent.

With the majority of the other S-Reits expected to disclose their updated portfolio valuations following the year-end asset revaluation, this might throw up more unpleasant surprises.

Key metrics and trends to watch

The way Morningstar analyst Xavier Lee views it, the market is already starting to see evidence of yield expansion in Singapore-based assets.

For example, he said, Link Reit’s acquisition of two suburban malls in Singapore came at an entry yield of 4.9 per cent – some 90 basis points above the yield in CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust’s sale of JCube 12 months earlier.

“This is likely just the beginning, and I expect to see yields adjust upwards during the course of the year,” Lee said.

Yield is expressed as a percentage based on the net property income (NPI) and the market value of an asset. Assuming NPI remains unchanged, an expanding yield thus implies a decline in asset value.

However, Lee is careful to add that yield expansion alone may not necessarily mean a downward revaluation across all properties. Other factors, such as rental growth, occupancy rates and void periods play a part as well, he said.

“I think the important thing to look out for here is to scrutinise how aggressive a Reit has been in valuing their assets,” Lee added.

At the same time, Lee warns that S-Reits with overseas assets could experience bigger movements on the valuation front.

“Investors should also bear in mind that foreign exchange risk exposure has the potential to be a multiplier on downward asset revaluation and pay close attention to S-Reits with significant foreign risk exposure,” he said.

Reits specialist Kenny Loh said he will be keeping an eye out for net asset value and distribution per unit growth trends.

“This is a test of the experience and capability level of the Reit management, the resiliency of their portfolio, and how the Reit manager navigated the tough external environment for the past year,” said Loh, who is also an independent financial adviser.

“Another area I will be paying attention to is how the Reits manage their debt by looking at the gearing ratio, interest coverage ratio, debt maturity profile, current interest cost and secured borrowing,” he added. “Failing to manage the liability aspect of the balance sheet will destroy the long-term prospect of the Reits.”

Subsectors in the crosshairs

At the top of market observers’ watchlist this earnings season will be the hospitality S-Reits, which are expected to ride on the tailwinds of the return of Chinese tourists.

“We look forward to commentary around forward bookings for the hospitality sector and visibility around supply of rooms which were offline for asset enhancements or government contracts,” said Maybank’s Guha.

Hospitality S-Reits scheduled to release their results for the full year ended December include CapitaLand Ascott Trust : HMN +2.26% and CDL Hospitality Trusts : J85 0% on Jan 30, as well as Far East Hospitality Trust on Feb 14.

S-Reits in the retail space are also likely to reap the benefits of the Chinese tourist dollar.

After three years under Covid-19 lockdowns, Loh said the “revenge travelling” and “revenge spending” phenomenon is expected to emerge.

“We see Singapore as a major beneficiary of the relaxation of travel restrictions in mainland China,” added Morningstar’s Lee. “Besides ranking high on the list of travel destinations for Chinese travellers, Singapore – unlike countries such as Japan and South Korea – also did not impose any Covid restrictions on Chinese travellers.”

Singapore suburban mall landlord Frasers Centrepoint Trust : J69U +1.44% will release its first-quarter business update on Jan 26, while retail peer Starhill Global Reit : P40U +1.04% will announce the results for its first half on Jan 27.

Meanwhile, China-focused Sasseur Reit : CRPU +0.76% is slated to release its full-year results on Feb 17.

At the same time, investors will also be wise to pay heed to warnings surrounding the office subsector.

“We think the strong rental growth seen in 2022 will be moderated by a slowdown in office leasing demand as companies turn cautious in the face of the rising risk of recession,” said Lee.

He noted that the expected completion of IOI Central Boulevard office development in Singapore this year would add significant new office supply.​

Office landlord Keppel Reit : K71U +1.2% will announce its full-year results on Jan 27, while the trio of US office S-Reits – Keppel Pacific Oak US Reit : CMOU +5%, Prime US Reit : OXMU +2.56% and Manulife US Reit – will release their full-year results on Feb 1, Feb 8 and Feb 9, respectively.

Other diversified S-Reits with office and commercial assets that are releasing their results for the year ended December 2022 include Suntec Reit : T82U +0.88% (Jan 20), OUE Commercial Reit : TS0U +2.22% (Jan 30), Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust : N2IU +2.19% (Jan 31), CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U +1.69% (Feb 1), CapitaLand China Trust : AU8U +0.58% (Feb 3), and Lendlease Global Commercial Reit : JYEU 0% (Feb 7).

Industrial S-Reit Mapletree Logistics Trust : M44U +1.94% is expected to kick off the Reit results announcements with its third-quarter update on Jan 19."
2023-01-25,Aims Apac Reit’s DPU rises 10.2% to S$0.0259 in Q3 on higher earnings,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/aims-apac-reits-dpu-rises-102-s00259-q3-higher-earnings,"AIMS Apac Reit’s distribution per unit (DPU) rose 10.2 per cent to S$0.0259 for the third quarter ended Dec 31, 2022, from S$0.0235 a year ago.

On Wednesday (Jan 25), the real estate investment trust (Reit) manager attributed the performance to higher gross revenue of S$42 million and net property income (NPI) of S$30.9 million. These represented a 14.1 per cent and 14 per cent increase year on year, from S$36.8 million and S$27.1 million, respectively. 

The increases in gross revenue and NPI come on the back of higher rental income from Singapore and Australia properties, and full-quarter revenue contribution from the acquisition of Woolworths’ headquarters, which completed on Nov 15, 2021.
The Reit’s distributable income also rose 11.7 per cent to S$18.7 million, from S$16.7 million a year ago.

The distribution will be paid on Mar 24, after books closure on Feb 3.
Despite being mindful of macro uncertainty and market volatility ahead, Russell Ng, the manager’s chief executive, believes Singapore’s industrial market in the near term will continue to be supported by favourable demand and supply dynamics.
Aims Apac Reit : O5RU +0.78% will focus on tenant retention and strengthen its portfolio through active asset enhancement, redevelopment, divestment and capital recycling, he said.

The weighted average lease expiry for the Reit’s portfolio was 4.5 years, and its tenant retention rate remained high at 79 per cent.

2023-01-26,"Navigating rough waters, CapitaLand Investment can surprise shareholders by distributing units in Reits",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/navigating-rough-waters-capitaland-investment-can-surprise-shareholders,"LIKE most of its property peers, CapitaLand Investment : 9CI +1.97% (CLI) is facing down a tough environment amid global economic uncertainties.

But perhaps the group can surprise its investors by doing a distribution in specie of units in real estate investment trusts (Reits) that it holds. 

The real estate investment manager trades at a superior book-value multiple compared with Singapore-listed property groups City Developments Limited : C09 +1.98% (CDL) and UOL Group : U14 +1.25%.
Over 2022, CLI’s share price rose 8.5 per cent while CDL’s jumped 20.9 per cent and UOL’s fell 5.2 per cent. 

Rising to the challenge

CLI’s business model makes it vulnerable to rising interest rates, as investors use higher discount rates to value CLI’s Reits and worry over rising borrowing costs of the trusts.
As volatile stock markets make it harder for Reits to buy assets, CLI may face difficulty earning acquisition fees or growing management fees from Reits scaling up via acquisitions.

Capital recycling – the selling of assets and deploying of monies in attractive opportunities – can get tricky for CLI under the current climate.

As geopolitical uncertainties cause decision-makers to adopt a risk-off approach, asset divestment may be harder.

Cost of capital also rises with higher interest rates, which potentially leads to deeper scrutiny of opportunities and less aggressive pricing by buyers. For 2022, CLI’s capital recycled was S$2.9 billion – shy of its annual target of S$3 billion. 

CLI‘s relatively large China exposure also raises uncertainty. As the country makes a messy exit from its zero-Covid strategy, it may take some time for consumer confidence and the economy in China to recover.

China, including Hong Kong, accounted for 32 per cent of the group’s total assets of S$36.4 billion as at end-September 2022.

On the other hand, CLI did well to launch private funds in tough market conditions last year. Expanding the private fund management business will help strengthen CLI’s asset-light and capital-efficient business model.

At the same time, CLI’s growing lodging business should benefit from post-Covid recovery.

Still, investors may fret over how CLI’s top management sees the investment landscape, and whether the group can maintain the dividend per share of S$0.15 that was paid for 2021, when CLI announces its full-year results.

Distribution in specie

Perhaps, CLI can surprise and reward its shareholders – while lightening its balance sheet – by distributing in specie to its shareholders some of the units it holds in its Singapore-listed trusts. 

As at end-September 2022, CLI held effective stakes of 23 per cent in CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U +2.26% (CICT), 18 per cent in CapitaLand Ascendas Reit : A17U +2.65%, 37 per cent in CapitaLand Ascott Trust : HMN +2.26%, 24 per cent in CapitaLand China Trust : AU8U +0.58%and 22 per cent in CapitaLand India Trust : CY6U 0%.

Hong Kong-listed ESR Group – the largest real asset manager in Asia-Pacific – holds under 10 per cent of units in Suntec Reit : T82U +0.88%. ESR’s ARA Asset Management owns the manager of Suntec Reit.

By holding smaller stakes in the listed trusts that it manages, CLI can become more asset-light while keeping the size of funds under management (FUM). CLI had FUM of around S$86 billion as at end-September 2022, and it intends to grow FUM to S$100 billion by 2024.

In November 2022, CLI announced the setting up of two onshore renminbi funds to invest in business park opportunities in China. CLI said that, aligned with its asset-light strategy to grow its FUM, it will hold stakes of 10 per cent and 20 per cent in these funds. 

Meanwhile, CLI holds a 10 per cent share of the initial equity commitment in its partnership with APG Asset Management to build an Asia-focused self-storage platform. APG is the investment manager for the largest pension provider in the Netherlands.

Holding a large stake in a Reit entrenches CLI’s position as the manager. However, holding a stake closer to 10 per cent in a Reit could be enough to show that the sponsor has skin in the game.

For one, if CLI holds smaller stakes in its various trusts, the free floats of the said trusts would improve.

Moreover, with CLI’s track record in managing Reits, investors will likely support CLI to manage the said trusts, even if it holds smaller stakes in them.

For example, if a CLI shareholder receives about 71 CICT units for 1,000 CLI shares held, the value of the CICT units received works out to around the S$0.15 dividend per share that CLI shareholders received for the last financial year, based on CICT’s unit price as at Jan 25, 2023. In this scenario, CLI distributes a stake amounting to under 6 per cent of CICT. 

CLI has a healthy cash balance, available undrawn facilities and a robust credit profile that positions it to weather future economic headwinds and capitalise on opportunities. It need not resort to distributing Reit units in order to minimise the cash dividend payable.

Nonetheless, CLI has room to lower the size of stakes held in its listed trusts. And CLI shareholders may be happy to get a mix of cash dividend and units of listed trusts.

CLI’s group chief executive officer Lee Chee Koon was named the Outstanding Chief Executive Of The Year for the Singapore Business Awards 2022. The group’s then group chief financial officer Andrew Lim was named the best CFO in the category for companies with over S$1 billion in market capitalisation at the Singapore Corporate Awards 2022.

Shareholders can be hopeful that CLI’s board and management will astutely steer the group through choppy waters of slower economic growth, high inflation and high interest rates, while looking after their interests well."
2023-01-27,Rental reversions for Keppel Reit’s Singapore CBD offices hit 23.4% in Q4,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/rental-reversions-keppel-reits-singapore-cbd-offices-hit-234-q4,"KEPPEL Reit secured positive rental reversions of 23.4 per cent for its office assets in Singapore’s central business district (CBD) in the fourth quarter of 2022, bringing its portfolio’s reversions for the full year to 10 per cent, its head of asset management Rodney Yeo said.

Speaking in an earnings call on Friday (Jan 27) after the real estate investment trust (Reit) posted a 1.7 per cent increase in distribution per unit (DPU) to S$0.0592 for FY2022 ended Dec 31, he said the Reit now expects reversions in the “mid to higher single digits” for leases expiring in 2023. 

The assessment is based on the manager’s view that 2023 would be a “tale of two halves”, with the first half probably faring better than the second. “In the first half, we are still trying to make hay while the sun shines, given that supply coming online at the end of 2023 or early 2024 from IOI Central Boulevard Towers would probably create a pause in the recent market rent increase,” Yeo said.
He added that the current high rental reversions seen in Singapore were not driven by any particular tenant or asset, but a CBD-wide trend seen through the rapidly rising rents that reached 30 to 40 per cent in some cases over the course of the year. 

But while the Reit is looking to absorb demand from offices relocating from Greater China, Yeo said such demand is “not a flood at the moment”, and is more of a trickle.

The Reit manager’s chief executive Koh Wee Lih said he is closely watching developments from the recent cost cuts in the tech sector, evidently seen through an intensifying number of layoff announcements from November.
While noting that many of the tech tenants carrying out the layoffs in Singapore are in the business park sector and are not part of Keppel Reit’s portfolio, he said the shadow space created in the market would have an impact.

Keppel Reit’s S$9.2 billion portfolio is mainly located in Singapore, with Marina Bay Financial Centre and One Raffles Quay in its ranks, but it also has assets in Australia, South Korea and Japan.

In its latest financials, the Reit reported that FY2022’s rise in DPU was driven by an increase in net property income (NPI), which rose 2 per cent to S$158.9 million from S$155.8 million a year prior. The NPI performance was due to a full year of contribution from Keppel Bay Tower, a Singapore property which it acquired in May 2021, as well as higher NPI from Ocean Financial Centre in Singapore and Pinnacle Office Park in Sydney.

However, this was offset by the divestment of Brisbane’s 275 George Street in July 2021, and lower NPI from Melbourne’s Victoria Police Centre and Seoul’s T Tower due to weak exchange rates.

The higher NPI for FY2022, coupled with the anniversary distribution of S$100 million, resulted in a 4.1 per cent increase in distribution to unitholders to S$220.9 million.

Keppel Reit’s committed occupancy for its portfolio stands at 96.3 per cent as at Dec 31, 2022. The weighted average lease expiry for its portfolio is six years, and 10.5 years for its top 10 tenants.

About 1.8 million square feet of space has been committed for lease in FY2022, with Singapore making up the bulk of the leases. The weighted average signing rent for Singapore office leases has increased to S$11.54 per square foot (psf) per month for FY2022, compared to S$11.47 psf per month for the first nine months of 2022. Tenant retention rate stands at 78 per cent for FY2022.

The Reit’s manager said it would remain focused on delivering long-term sustainable returns. “The manager will continue to manage the impact of rising interest costs as well as drive operational excellence and ensure a disciplined approach in executing its portfolio optimisation strategy,” it said in a statement.

Units of Keppel Reit closed 3.7 per cent or S$0.035 higher at S$0.97 on Friday."
2023-01-30,Sabana Reit H2 DPU falls 7% to S$0.0146 on higher interest expenses,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/sabana-reit-h2-dpu-falls-7-s00146-higher-interest-expenses,"SABANA Industrial Real Estate Investment Trust : M1GU -1.28% (Sabana Reit) posted a distribution per unit (DPU) of 1.46 Singapore cents for the half-year ended Dec 31, 2022, down 7 per cent from a year earlier.

In a bourse filing on Monday (Jan 30), its manager attributed the DPU decline to higher interest expenses.

Gross revenue rose 16.9 per cent to S$50.1 million from S$42.8 million, mainly due to higher contributions from New Tech Park as well as the portfolio’s assets at Tuas, Chai Chee Lane, Serangoon North and Changi South.
Net property income (NPI) remained stable at S$26.3 million, remaining consistent year on year. 

The latest H2 results brings the Reit’s FY2022 DPU to 3.05 cents, unchanged from the previous year.

FY2022 gross revenue was up 15.9 per cent to S$94.9 million from S$81.9 million in FY2021, while NPI rose 2.6 per cent to S$53.3 million as the full-year increase in revenue was largely offset by a surge in utility expenses amid global energy inflation.
As at end-December 2022, the Reit’s portfolio’s occupancy rate stood at 91.2 per cent excluding occupancy data from 1 Tuas Avenue 4, which is undergoing asset enhancement initiative works. This is 2.8 percentage points higher than the previous year’s, driven primarily by positive rental reversion rates in Q4.

Sabana Reit’s portfolio valuation for its 18 properties saw a further uplift by 2.3 per cent on-year to S$885.7 million as at end-2022, due to higher signing rents for both new and renewed leases across the portfolio as well as the securing of a new master lease tenant at 30 & 32 Tuas Avenue 8.

With an aggregate leverage of 32.4 per cent as at end-2022, the Reit has a debt headroom of S$156.1 million with a weighted average debt maturity at 2.8 years. The next refinancing requirement is due in Q4 of 2024.

Looking ahead, the manager said it remains cautiously optimistic on its mid-term outlook, and continues to see steady demand in the Singapore industrial sector.

Units of Sabana Reit ended Friday unchanged at S$0.45."
2023-01-30,Keppel Infrastructure Trust H2 DPU slips 0.5% to S$0.0191,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/keppel-infrastructure-trust-h2-dpu-slips-05-s00191,"THE manager of Keppel Infrastructure Trust (KIT) reported on Monday (Jan 30) a distribution per unit (DPU) of S$0.0191 for the second half ended December 2022, down 0.5 per cent from the DPU of S$0.0192 in the year-ago period.

The lower DPU came even as KIT’s distributable income rose 47.4 per cent in the second half to S$134.9 million, from S$91.6 million previously.

The latest distribution will be paid on Feb 14.
For the full year, distributable income was up 15.8 per cent to S$222.5 million, with new acquisitions and “steady portfolio performance” contributing to the increase, the manager said.

Meanwhile, full-year DPU rose 1 per cent to S$0.0382. The manager noted that this translated to a distribution yield of 7.1 per cent, based on KIT’s closing price of S$0.54 on Dec 31, 2022.

The trust’s energy transition segment contributed to the biggest increase in distributable income for the full year. Distributable income from the segment rose from S$74.4 million to S$115.7 million.
Distributable income from KIT’s distribution and storage segment rose 9.5 per cent to S$102.6 million.

However, distributable income from the environmental services segment slipped 1.5 per cent to S$70.3 million.

Revenue for the full-year rose to S$2 billion from S$1.6 billion in FY21.

The manager said the trust is “well-positioned against inflation and higher energy prices with over 90 per cent of KIT’s businesses and assets with cost pass through a mechanism and availability-based revenue model”.

The manager also added that the trust has conducted its inaugural portfolio revaluation exercise, with total assets under management as at Dec 31, 2022 amounting to S$7.3 billion

KIT had net gearing of 39.8 per cent as at Dec 31, 2022, and the manager noted it had “comfortable debt headroom for growth”. Around 72 per cent of KIT’s floating interest rates were hedged, and the trust had a weighted average interest rate of 3.7 per cent.

KIT units rose 0.9 per cent on Monday to close at S$0.57 before the earnings announcement. "
2023-01-30,OUE C-Reit H2 DPU falls 24.1% to S$0.0104 despite higher revenue,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/oue-c-reit-h2-dpu-falls-241-s00104-despite-higher-revenue,"THE manager of OUE Commercial Real Estate Investment Trust (OUE C-Reit) reported on Monday (Jan 30) a 24.1 per cent year-on-year decline in distribution per unit (DPU) for the second half ended December 2022.

DPU for the six-month period fell to S$0.0104 from S$0.0137 in the year-ago period, even though the revenue for the second half grew 8 per cent on year to S$125.7 million.

Net property income (NPI) also climbed 8.6 per cent on year in the second half to S$103.3 million.
The improved revenue and NPI were largely driven by lower rental rebates, partially offset by higher property expenses, the manager said.

However, OUE C-Reit’s amount available for distribution fell 19.1 per cent on-year to S$52.1 million, which was due to “lower income support for OUE Downtown Office and higher interest expense driven by macroeconomic factors”.

For the full-year ended Dec 31, 2022, OUE C-Reit’s amount available for distribution also fell 15.2 per cent to S$111.6 million.
DPU for the full year was 18.5 per cent lower, slipping to S$0.0212 in FY22 from S$0.026 in FY21. Based on OUE C-Reit’s unit closing price of S$0.335 as at the last trading day of 2022, FY 2022 distribution yield would be 6.3 per cent.

The manager noted that OUE C-Reit’s commercial segment, comprising office and retail, recorded higher revenue and net property income in the second half due to lower rental rebates and property expenses.

“Positive rental reversions ranging from 3.2 per cent to 8.3 per cent were recorded across all Singapore office properties in Q4 2022, with average passing rents remaining stable as of end December,” the manager said.

“OUE C-Reit’s Singapore portfolio of core Grade-A offices with high occupancies and a well-diversified tenant base is expected to underpin a stable performance in 2023,” it added.

Han Khim Siew, chief executive officer of the manager, said the second half of 2022 was characterised by “continued operating challenges posed by geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, interest rate hikes and macroeconomic headwinds”.

He noted that the manager has been focused on strengthening the Reit’s capital structure and improving asset performance.

As at Dec 31, 2022, OUE C-Reit’s aggregate leverage fell 1.5 percentage points from the previous quarter to 38.8 per cent. Its weighted average cost of debt remained stable at 3.4 per cent per annum. Around 71.5 per cent of its total debt of S$2.3 billion is on a fixed-rate basis.

“While we will surely face macroeconomic headwinds in the year ahead, we remain confident in our ability to navigate market uncertainties and deliver positive results for FY 2023, with the support of our stakeholders,” Han added.

OUE C-Reits units closed unchanged at S$0.37 on Monday, before the earnings announcement.

2023-01-30,CDL Hospitality Trusts’ H2 DPS up 17.3% to S$0.0359 on continued global travel recovery,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/cdl-hospitality-trusts-h2-dps-173-s00359-continued-global-travel-recovery,"CDL Hospitality Trusts’ : J85 0% (CDLHT) distribution per stapled security (DPS) rose 17.3 per cent to S$0.0359 for the second half of 2022 ended Dec 31, from S$0.0306 a year earlier.

Managers of the stapled group on Monday (Jan 30) observed positive momentum in rate growth across all its portfolio markets due to continued global travel recovery during the half-year period. The return of corporate groups and citywide events reinforced the recovery initially spurred by leisure demand, they added. 

Gross revenue for the half year rose 42.9 per cent to S$130.7 million from S$91.5 million, while net property income (NPI) increased 48.1 per cent to S$72.8 million from S$49.1 million. 
The rise in NPI was mainly attributed to the Singapore portfolio, which saw an NPI increase of SS$27.4 million year on year. 

CDLHT’s fourth quarter revenue per available room (RevPAR) for Singapore hotels, which includes W Singapore Sentosa Cove and Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel, grew 105.2 per cent to S$220 from S$107. This brought the H2 RevPAR to S$209, a 129.3 per cent rise from S$91 a year earlier.

Despite the absence of inbound visitors from China, Singapore’s biggest pre-pandemic inbound market, marquee events such as the Singapore Grand Prix in September 2022 drove the tourism rebound.
On the other hand, the NPI for its New Zealand Hotel and Maldives Resorts declined by S$11.3 million over H2, while RevPAR for New Zealand also decreased 46.7 per cent to NZ$98 (S$84) from NZ$185 a year ago as long-haul flight capacity remained limited to only certain types travellers. 

Nonetheless, the managers expect the upcoming 2023 Fifa Women’s World Cup jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand in Q3 2023 to boost international tourism numbers to the region.

Meanwhile, H2 RevPAR for the Maldives also decreased 5.8 per cent to US$263 from US$280 the year before, impacted by weaker top-line performance in Q4 amid the reopening of competitor resorts, as well as rising inflationary costs. 

With China’s border reopening, the managers noted that the return of the largest pre-pandemic visitor source market to the Maldives should mitigate the impact of the new supply of resorts, as well as the reopening of other resort destinations.
CDLHT’s Japan hotels saw NPI increase by S$700,000 year on year to S$1 million for H2 2022, on the lifting of pandemic-related entry restrictions last October. 

DPS for FY2022 was S$0.0563, up 31.9 per cent from S$0.0427 a year earlier. 

Gross revenue for the full year was S$229.4 million, up 45.4 per cent from S$157.7 million last year. NPI rose 43.7 per cent to S$123.7 million from S$86.1 million.

As at Dec 31, CDLHT’s total portfolio value increased by 6.2 per cent or S$163.7 million year on year to S$2.8 billion, mainly due to the Singapore portfolio, the inclusion of Hotel Brooklyn and construction progress of The Castings.

Vincent Yeo, chief executive officer of CDLHT’s managers, said that amid a gloomy economic environment, exacerbated by higher borrowing costs and inflationary cost pressures, it is gratifying to see travel demand continuing its robust recovery trajectory.

“China’s reopening should boost international tourism in 2023 and beyond, helping to mitigate the inflationary cost challenges and higher interest rate environment,” Yeo added.

Stapled securities of CDLHT rose 0.8 per cent or S$0.01 to close at S$1.35 on Friday. "
2023-02-01,CICT’s H2 DPU up 2.7% to S$0.0536; market watchers mostly optimistic despite earnings miss,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/cicts-h2-dpu-27-s00536-market-watchers-mostly-optimistic-despite-earnings-miss,"CAPITALAND Integrated Commercial Trust’s : C38U +2.26% (CICT) distribution per unit (DPU) for the half year ended December 2022 rose 2.7 per cent year on year to S$0.0536, compared with S$0.0522 from FY2021.

The real estate investment trust’s (Reit) H2 FY2022 DPU was slightly lower than consensus estimates, as higher financing expenses offset gains from higher rental income and contributions from acquisitions.

“I know (DPU) is below market consensus, but I think we’ve done a little bit of things and hopefully going forward we’ll see some improvement from there,” said Tony Tan, chief executive of the Reit manager, at a briefing accompanying the results announcement on Wednesday (Feb 1).
“Bear in mind that we also have certain potential measures that will help improve the operating numbers going into 2023,” he added.

The way Citi analyst Brandon Lee sees it, CICT’s H2 results painted a positive picture on the ongoing recovery in Singapore’s retail sector.

Lee noted that CICT’s retail segment posted a fourth straight quarter of positive rent reversion amid improved occupancy rates. Tenants’ sales also remained above pre-Covid levels.
While the office segment appears to be slowing down in terms of rent reversions and leasing demand, Lee forecasts that rent reversions for CICT’s office portfolio will remain positive in FY2023 amid competitive rents.

“Despite the slight earnings miss today, we maintain our ‘buy’ rating in view of decent DPU growth – driven by increased income from CapitaSpring and 2 asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs) in Singapore – (as well as) continued recovery in the Singapore retail sector and potential redevelopment opportunities,” Lee said in a flash note.

For H2 FY2022, CICT posted a 14.4 per cent year-on-year increase in gross revenue to S$754.1 million, compared with S$659.4 million the previous year.

Net property income (NPI) for the second half rose 13.1 per cent year on year to S$541.7 million. 

The topline increase was mainly driven by contributions from the trust’s recently acquired interests in CapitaSky in Singapore as well as assets in Australia, along with higher rental income from most of the Singapore assets. 

This was however partially offset by higher operating expenses and the divestment of JCube, which was completed in March 2022.
CICT’s distributable income for H2 rose 4.8 per cent year on year to S$355.1 million from S$338.8 million the previous year. The record date for H2 DPU is Feb 9 and unitholders can expect to receive the payout on Mar 17.

For FY2022 ended Dec 31, DPU rose 1.7 per cent to S$0.1058 from S$0.104 in FY2021. 

Gross revenue for the full year increased by 10.5 per cent year on year to S$1.44 billion compared with S$1.31 billion previously. NPI rose by 9.7 per cent year on year to S$1.04 billion from S$951.1 million in FY2021. 

Tan noted that CICT’s NPI crossed the S$1 billion mark for the first time, calling it a “major milestone” for the Reit.
Based on CICT’s proportionate interests in its investment properties and joint ventures as at Dec 31, the trust’s aggregate portfolio property value increased by 8.9 per cent year on year to S$24.2 billion. 

Committed portfolio occupancy for retail and office properties as well as integrated developments was 98.3 per cent, 94.4 per cent and 97.1 per cent respectively as at Dec 31, bringing the total committed portfolio occupancy to 95.8 per cent. 

In FY2022, the trust signed approximately 2.5 million square feet (sq ft) of new leases and renewals, comprising around 1 million sq ft of retail space and 1.5 million sq ft of office space. The tenant retention rate for its retail properties and office properties in Singapore was 89.1 per cent and 80.9 per cent, respectively.

CICT’s manager expects Singapore’s commercial portfolio to benefit from continued consumption recovery, mainly due to an anticipated increase in tourist arrivals and a repositioned retail tenant trade mix. 

Tan said the Reit manager will focus on riding the tailwinds of post-pandemic recovery to improve its operating metrics while navigating macroeconomic uncertainties to manage costs.

“There are some dark clouds out there. Everyone knows about it; there’s no surprise,” Tan said. “We have not seen a very widespread impact in Singapore yet, but because the environment is in the mood of rationalisation… in line with what some consultants are saying, we’ll probably see a little bit of slowdown in terms of rental growth going into 2023.”

“Nevertheless, there are other positive factors underpinning Singapore’s office market,” he added.

At the same time, Tan said the Reit is on track to complete its ongoing AEI at CQ @ Clarke Quay by this year. “We are already planning ahead… (and) there are a couple of projects we are studying,” he said.

At CICT’s closing price of S$2.14 on Tuesday, Lim & Tan Securities noted that the trust is capitalised at S$14.2 billion and is up 5 per cent this year to slightly beat Straits Times Index’s 3.5 per cent gain.

The brokerage on Wednesday morning noted that the consensus one-year target of S$2.23 implies a potential upside of just 4.2 per cent.

This, coupled with a “higher for longer” terminate rate outlook as well as fair valuations, has prompted Lim & Tan to downgrade its call on CICT to “hold”.

Meanwhile, Citi’s Lee noted that CICT is expected to see a “slight negative share price reaction” following the earnings miss.

Units of CICT are trading 1.4 per cent or S$0.03 lower at S$2.11 as at 3.49pm on Wednesday, following the results announcement."
2023-02-02,Brokers’ take: Analysts mixed on CICT’s outlook despite higher DPU,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/brokers-take-analysts-mixed-cicts-outlook-despite-higher-dpu,"(CICT) recent H2 FY2022 earnings drew mixed reactions from analysts despite the trust recording a 2.7 per cent increase in distribution per unit (DPU) to S$0.0536.

RHB Research downgraded its call to “neutral” from “buy” with an unchanged target price of S$2, noting that the trust’s growth is comparatively lower than its peers even though it reported improving operating portfolio metrics in Q4 and FY2022. 

In a report on Thursday (Feb 2), analyst Vijay Natarajan said he deemed valuations fair as the trust is currently trading at its book value, and offers 5 per cent dividend yields. 
Natarajan estimated CICT’s positive momentum to sustain in H1 FY2023 before slowing down in the second half of the year, with operational gains being offset by higher interest and inflationary pressures.
The research house trimmed FY2023 and FY2024 DPU forecasts for CICT by 2-3 per cent, while estimating overall interest cost for borrowings in FY2023 to be in the mid-3 per cent levels, up from 2.7 per cent. 

On the other hand, DBS Group Research raised its target price to S$2.40 from $2.20 while reiterating its “buy” call on CICT, as it said the trust will benefit from a broad recovery trajectory. 
Unlike RHB, DBS said CICT is currently trading at a “very attractive level to ride on the growth trajectory”. 

Due to expectations of more rental income contributions from FY2023 onwards, the brokerage is positive on CICT’s DPU growth prospects, which it said will be further boosted by operational normalisation once ongoing asset enhancement initiatives are completed. 

It liked CICT for its ability to deliver a two-year DPU compound annual growth rate of about 4 per cent “despite the cloudy macroeconomic conditions”. 

It also highlighted the trust as one of the few Singapore real estate investment trusts with an opportunity to acquire newly completed prime commercial assets in Singapore, potentially from its sponsor pipeline. 

The return of Chinese tourists could further provide upside to its unit price as CICT’s retail portfolio would stand to see a stronger recovery, according to DBS. 

Meanwhile, CGS-CIMB tweaked its FY2023 to FY2024 earnings estimates marginally downwards, following the release of CICT’s latest results. 

The brokerage nonetheless maintained “add” on the trust with an unchanged target price of S$2.35, noting improving rental reversions along with the continued trend of rising average funding costs. 

Units of CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust traded 1.4 per cent or S$0.03 higher at S$2.14 as at 12.17 pm."

The real estate investment trust (Reit) listed on the Singapore Exchange in December 2021. The manager noted in the bourse filing that DPU for H2 FY22 was lower than the US$0.0209 forecast disclosed in its initial public offering prospectus in November 2021.

For H2 FY22, the Reit reported gross revenue of US$54.9 million, up 3.6 per cent from its forecast. However, property expenses were also higher than expected.


This resulted in distributable income to unitholders of US$21.5 million for H2 FY22, lower than the US$23.8 million forecasted.

For the full FY2022, Digital Core’s DPU stood at US$0.0398, 4.8 per cent lower than the US$0.0418 forecasted.

Gross revenue for the full year came in at US$107.7 million, slightly higher than the US$105.9 million forecasted. Meanwhile, distributable income for the full year was 5.8 per cent lower than forecasted, coming in at US$44.8 million.“Digital Core Reit delivered solid results in 2022 despite the rapidly evolving environment,” John J. Stewart, chief executive of the manager, said.

“We remain focused on leasing up vacancy, proactively managing controllable costs and investing accretively to continue to create sustainable value for unitholders.”

Digital Core Reit’s portfolio was 98 per cent leased as at Dec 31, 2022 with a weighted average lease expiration of approximately 4.5 years.

The Reit had US$500 million of total debt outstanding as at end-2022, consisting entirely of unsecured term loans due 2025-2027.

The manager added that aggregate leverage was 34 per cent and the weighted average cost of debt was approximately 3.9 per cent. Around 75 per cent of total interest rate exposure was hedged as at Dec 31, 2022, up from 50 per cent as at Jun 30, 2022.

2023-02-07,"Amid excitement over tourism rebound, don’t overlook industrial S-Reit resilience",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/amid-excitement-over-tourism-rebound-dont-overlook-industrial-s-reit,"PLENTY of ink has been spilled about the hospitality sector rebound following China’s relaxation of border restrictions to restrict the spread of Covid-19.

To a lesser – though still significant – extent, the retail sector has also been touted as one of the key beneficiaries of an impending influx of Chinese tourists.

But investors should not overlook the resilience and potential upside of Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) in the industrial space.
In a recent conversation with a Reit manager, I was reminded about how challenging it is for S-Reits in the industrial sector to make the news – unless for the wrong reasons.

For one, most industrial properties are tucked in the lesser-visited parts of Singapore: Tuas, for instance, or Changi. For retail investors, out of sight often means out of mind.

Besides, the acquisition of a ramp-up logistics property – no matter how state-of-the-art it is purported to be – would struggle to capture the imagination compared with a more familiar hotel or shopping mall.
Consider, for instance, the recent sale of a portfolio of heartland mall properties by NTUC unit Mercatus.

The Singapore market was abuzz as Hong Kong-listed Link Reit snapped up Mercatus’ Jurong Point and Swing By @ Thomson Plaza retail assets, while Frasers Centrepoint Trust : J69U +1.91% (FCT) and sponsor Frasers Property : TQ5 -1.22% (FPL) teamed up to buy a 50 per cent stake in Nex.

It was probably less exciting to hear that Mapletree Logistics Trust : M44U +2.58% (MLT) was selling two warehouses in Malaysia and a property at Changi South Lane.

Yet, some industrial S-Reits prove their resilience last year. And it would be foolish to overlook their place in a well-balanced portfolio.

Credit Suisse noted in a research report that prices and rentals of industrial properties in Singapore rose for the ninth consecutive quarter in the fourth quarter of 2022 ended December, gaining 2.1 per cent quarter on quarter or 6.9 per cent year on year.
While rental reversion is forecast to moderate in 2023 due to softer economic and manufacturing growth momentum, large-cap industrial S-Reits with well-diversified portfolios and prudent balance sheets could continue to be favoured for their defensiveness.

This year, the expectation of a slower pace of interest rate increases has been a key catalyst for the S-Reit market.

The iEdge S-Reit Index posted total returns of 7.1 per cent in January – double that of the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI), which generated total returns of 3.5 per cent for the month.

More than half of the dozen S-Reits with industrial assets did at least as well as the iEdge S-Reit Index, while all but three outperformed the STI.

The industrial S-Reits that are also constituents of the STI – Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust : BUOU +0.93%, MLT, Mapletree Industrial Trust : ME8U +2.29% and CapitaLand Ascendas Reit : A17U +3.03% – all outpaced the benchmark index in terms of total returns.
The top performer among the S-Reits with industrial exposure was CapitaLand China Trust : AU8U +1.17% (CLCT), a diversified S-Reit whose China-focused portfolio mainly comprises retail assets but also includes business parks and logistics parks properties.

For the second half ended December, CLCT reported a 24.4 per cent drop in distribution per unit (DPU). Gross revenue and net property income (NPI) fell 8.6 per cent and 11.8 per cent, respectively.

While its retail malls segment was shaken by Covid-related disruptions in China, the Reit manager noted that its business parks and logistics parks segments showed positive year-on-year performance for the full year.
Another top industrial S-Reit performer was Aims Apac Reit : O5RU +0.78% (AA Reit), which achieved total returns of 10.5 per cent in January.

For its Q3 ended December, AA Reit recorded a 10.2 per cent increase in DPU on the back of a 14.1 per cent growth in gross revenue and a 14 per cent rise in NPI.

Despite potential macroeconomic headwinds and market volatility ahead, the Reit manager said the near-term outlook for Singapore’s industrial market will continue to be supported by favourable demand and supply dynamics."
2023-02-07,Lendlease Global Commercial Reit H1 DPU up 2.1% to S$0.0245,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/lendlease-global-commercial-reit-h1-dpu-21-s00245,"THE manager of Lendlease Global Commercial Reit : JYEU +0.97% (Lendlease Reit) posted distribution per unit (DPU) of S$0.0245 for the first half FY2023 ended December 2022, up 2.1 per cent from S$0.024 in the corresponding period a year ago.

Distributable income rose 95.9 per cent to S$56 million, from S$28.6 million in the previous year.

Gross revenue more than doubled to S$101.7 million in H1 FY2023, from S$39.2 million in H1 FY2022. The increase was mainly due to contributions from Jem, which was acquired in April 2022, as well as the easing of Covid-19 measures.
This was partly offset by lower revenue from the Sky Complex office asset in Milan due to a weaker euro against the Singapore dollar.

Net property income surged to S$76.4 million, from S$29.6 million.

The DPU for H1 will be paid out on Mar 30.
Committed occupancy rate at Lendlease Reit’s retail portfolio stood at 99.5 per cent as at Dec 31, 2022, with a positive retail rental reversion of about 2 per cent for the period.

Its office portfolio saw positive rental escalation of about 4 per cent, with a weighted average lease expiry (Wale) of 12.4 years by net lettable area and 15.3 years by gross rental income.

The real estate investment trust (Reit) manager said the long Wale ensured “a stable income stream” for unitholders.

“We are optimistic that Lendlease Reit’s retail assets will benefit from China’s reopening to generate higher footfall and tenants’ sales for our retail properties,” said Kelvin Chow, chief executive of the Reit manager.

Lendlease Reit’s aggregate leverage stood at 39.2 per cent as at Dec 31, 2022, down from 39.4 per cent as at end-June.

Its weighted average cost of debt rose to 2.35 per cent, from 2.24 per cent previously, while interest coverage ratio fell to 5.5 times, from 6.9 times previously."
2023-02-12,S-Reits see resilience in diversification,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/s-reits-see-resilience-diversification,"AS Singapore Reits and property trusts continue to diversify in terms of asset mix, diversified S-Reits now make up the largest sub-segment of the sector. More diversification can improve a Reit’s resilience to external shocks and allow it to capture growth trends across a multitude of segments.

Today, there are nine diversified S-Reits, making up almost a quarter of the total number of S-Reits. This is compared to the start of 2020, where diversified S-Reits only accounted for 14 per cent of the sector.

Eight out of the nine diversified S-Reits have reported their latest financial results. Among them, five announced full year results – CapitaLand China Trust : AU8U +1.17%, CapitaLand India Trust : CY6U 0%, CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U +2.26%, OUE Commercial Reit : TS0U +2.22% and Suntec Reit : T82U +0.88%.
CapitaLand China Trust (CLCT) announced a net property income (NPI) of S$254.2 million for FY2022, 1.5 per cent higher than FY2021. This was mainly contributed by the acquisitions made across business and logistics parks in 2021. It expanded its investment mandate in September 2020 to cover multi-assets including retail, office and industrial segments. CLCT noted that its strategic pivot to create a diversified portfolio has helped to weather the impact of Covid-19 in FY2022, with contributions from its new economy assets mitigating the softness in its retail portfolio.

CapitaLand India Trust (CLINT) reported a 7 per cent year-on-year increase in NPI, resulting in a 5 per cent increase in distribution per unit (DPU) to 8.19 Singapore cents. This was mainly attributed to higher portfolio occupancy and income from new acquisitions, including its first industrial facility acquired in 2022. Aside from industrial assets, CLINT also made its first entry into the data centre sector in India back in 2021.

CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT), which also attributed its growth to contributions from newly acquired assets, reported a year-on-year increase of 10.5 per cent in gross revenue, which led to a 9.7 per cent growth in NPI over the same period.
OUE Commercial Reit (OUE C-Reit) reported overall NPI of S$196.9 million, down 3.6 per cent year-on-year. NPI for the commercial segment, which consists of retail and office assets, declined 5.3 per cent to S$133.5 million but was slightly offset by the hospitality segment which was up 0.2 per cent to S$63.4 million. Looking ahead, OUE C-Reit expects stable performance in its core Grade A office portfolio despite lower rental growth forecast due to expectations of weaker global economic growth. It is also optimistic about the recovery of the retail and hospitality segments with the reopening of China borders and pickup in tourism activities.

Suntec Reit reported NPI of S$315.8 million for FY2022, 24 per cent higher year-on-year. This was mainly due to higher contributions from Suntec City in Singapore and The Minster Building in London. As a result, DPU grew 2.5 per cent to 8.88 Singapore cents. The Reit expects the return of tourists and meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (Mice) events to have positive contributions to its retail and convention businesses."
2023-02-12,Two S-Reits lead the STI in early 2023,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/two-s-reits-lead-sti-early-2023,"FOR Q1 2023 through to Feb 9, the Straits Times Index (STI) has added a 3.6 per cent total return to the 8.4 per cent total return booked in 2022. The STI also formed a nine-month high of 3,408.19 on Jan 30, which followed on from a key US inflation report, and coincided with the Singapore stock market’s busiest trading session since the end of 2022.

While the STI ranked among the globe’s strongest stock benchmarks in 2022, the past six weeks have seen European, and in Asia, Taiwan and South Korean stock indices lead the performance tallies. This indicates that for all the focus on global inflation, growth outlooks have also remained key market drivers. As the IMF relayed from Singapore on Jan 31, European “economic growth in 2022 was more resilient than expected” and China’s “recent reopening has paved the way for a faster-than-expected recovery”. This has seen regional markets more focused on the renewed outlook for China growth, and less focused on the trail of trade contractions booked by Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore since October.

The STI continues to be home to 30 different stocks that on the whole report generally as much revenue outside Singapore as within Singapore. Much of this international revenue is aligned with the same destinations that Singapore maintains its strongest trade relationships with, that is, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Indonesia. After Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings) : BS6 +0.63% led the STI in 2022 with a 107.4 per cent total return, it has been the least performing STI constituent in Q1 2023 to Feb 9, with an 8.8 per cent decline. The Jiangsu-based shipbuilder’s orderbook is mainly denominated in USD and stood at 143 vessels with US$10.3 billion in contract value as at November 2022. At the same time, Keppel DC Reit : AJBU +0.98% (KDCR) and Frasers Logistic & Commercial Trust : BUOU +0.93% (FLCT) which were among the three least performing STI constituents in 2022, have led the STI over in Q1 2023 to Feb 9. This has coincided with the iEdge S-Reit Index generating a 6.6 per cent total return over the 26 sessions and 10-year US Treasury yields declining from 3.88 per cent to 3.66 per cent’
Keppel DC Reit
Acquisitions and prudent capital management have helped KDCR offset the overarching theme of inflation which has impacted electricity, staff and maintenance costs. As reported in January, the 7.7 per cent FY2022 growth in KDCR’s distributable income was attributed to the addition of quality assets and proactive asset management.

The past two years saw more than half of the stocks that make up the S-Reit sector pursue acquisitions, with a combined deal value of about S$20 billion.

Back in Q1 2021, the chairman and non-executive director of the manager, Christina Tan reiterated that KDCR would “leverage the unique strengths of the Keppel Group in project development and facilities management, to continue to pursue strategic growth opportunities that complement KDCR’s portfolio, as well as strengthen its presence across key data centre hubs”. In Q1 2021, KDCR maintained an interest coverage ratio (ICR) of 13.1x, while in the United States, Nareit estimated the median or typical ICR across the Reit universe was 4.0x.
KDCR has since pressed ahead with acquisitions, completing the acquisitions of London Data Centre on Jan 11, 2022, Guangdong Data Centre 2 and the building shell of Guangdong Data Centre 3 (scheduled to be fully fitted by Q3 FY2023) on Aug 12, 2022. Prior to this, in 2021, KDCR completed the acquisitions of Eindhoven Data Centre and Guangdong Data Centre 1. These acquisitions contributed to FY2022 distributable income. KDCR maintained approximately S$3.7 billion of AUM as of Dec 31, 2022. This was up from S$3.4 billion as at end 2021, S$3.0 billion at end of 2020, and S$1.0 billion at IPO on Dec 12, 2014.

On the capital management side, from the end of 2021 to the end of 2022, KDCR’s aggregate leverage marginally increased from 34.6 per cent to 36.4 per cent, while the average cost of debt increased from 1.6 per cent to 2.2 per cent. As of Dec 31, 2022, as much as 74 per cent of the loans were fixed through interest rate swaps, with a sensitivity analysis showing a 100 bps increase for the unhedged loans would have had a ~2.1 per cent impact to Q4 2022’s DPU on a pro forma basis.

The manager also borrows in currencies that correspond with its investments to provide a natural hedge to the extent possible, and the borrowings are diversified across five currencies. Nonetheless the incremental cost of debt in FY2022 from FY2021 has seen the ICR of KDCR decline to 7.6x at the end of 2022. However, the ICR remains well above the stipulated 2.5x minimum level that enables a property fund to expand its aggregate leverage from 45 per cent to 50 per cent.  

Demand for cloud adoption, smart technologies, big‐data analytics, and 5G deployment have also provided a secular growth outlook with Danseb Consulting forecasting 15 per cent growth in the global colocation market in 2023, with hyperscalers accounting for the bulk of the growth. Since listing in December 2014, KDCR has generated 16 per cent annualised total returns, and was included into the STI in October 2020.

Frasers Logistic & Commercial Trust
FLCT was created by the S$6.0 billion merger between Frasers Logistics & Industrial Trust and Frasers Commercial Trust in early 2020. The diversified Reit derives its income from properties in Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the UK. While the Singapore dollar had appreciated strongly against the Australian dollar, euro, and British pound in its FY2022, these currency pairs are currently not far off their respective end of September levels.FLCT’s 105 properties maintained a portfolio value of S$6.7 billion as at Dec 31, excluding the three properties under development in the UK and right-of-use assets. As much as 68 per cent of the portfolio is currently represented by logistics and industrials properties, with 23 per cent represented by office and business parks and 9 per cent represented by CBD commercial properties.  

The Reit has a proven track record in undertaking value-accretive acquisitions, and portfolio recycling. For FLCT’s FY2022 (ended Sep 30), the sale of Cross Street Exchange saw the rebalancing of the portfolio to maintain a logistics and industrial bias. The manager of FLCT also executed a number of value accretive acquisitions, with an aggregate value of approximately S$342.0 million over the year.

From the end of 2021 to the end of 2022, FLCT’s aggregate leverage decreased from 34.3 per cent to 27.9 per cent, while the average cost of borrowings increased from 1.6 per cent to 1.7 per cent. As of Dec 31, 2022, as much as 78.7 per cent of the borrowings were on fixed rates and FLCT maintained a 13.6x interest cover ratio.  FLCT noted in its Q1 FY2023 Business Update that every potential 50 bps increase in interest rates on variable rate borrowings is estimated to impact DPU by 0.06 Singapore cents.

FLCT also highlighted in the Q1 FY2023 business update, the logistics & industrial portfolio continued to maintain 100 per cent occupancy, which has been the case since the end of 2019. This has been on the back of robust demand from tenants operating across a number of sectors, including new economy industries with strong tailwinds. Sustaining demand were three current global trends: the continued growth of e-commerce, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to the last two years; the evolution of inventory management models to enhance supply chain security; and the transition to net-zero carbon.

Using the listing of Frasers Logistics & Industrial Trust in June 2016 as base, FLCT has since generated 12 per cent annualised total returns, and joined the STI in April 2021."
2023-02-14,FLCT manager’s chief executive steps down for family reasons,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/flct-managers-chief-executive-steps-down-family-reasons,"THE chief executive officer (CEO) of Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust’s : BUOU +0.93% (FLCT) manager has decided to step down for family reasons “after a lot of reflection”.

Robert Wallace will remain at his post until May 31, 2023 before returning to Australia to be with his family, announced the manager on Tuesday (Feb 14).

Until then, he will be working closely with the management team and board of directors to ensure a smooth transition.
The appointment of his replacement will be announced in due course. 

Wallace, who has been chief executive of the manager since 2016, is responsible for driving the overall business and investment strategies of FLCT. He provides leadership for the day-to-day management of the business, ensuring the effective implementation of FLCT’s business plans.

FLCT’s portfolio value quadrupled from an initial S$1.6 billion to over S$6.6 billion under his leadership, said the manager.
Highlighting his “strong leadership and unrelenting dedication to FLCT” over the last seven years, Ho Hon Cheong, board chairman, non-executive and independent director of the manager, said Wallace was “invaluable” in leading the merger between Frasers Logistics & Industrial Trust with Frasers Commercial Trust.

Following the merger, the enlarged entity was renamed FLCT in April 2020.

“The progress at FLCT since then has been nothing short of incredible, and the team will continue to carry it forward. We are happy for Rob to be back home with his family and wish him all the best for his next chapter,” said Ho.

Units of FLCT ended S$0.06 or 4.58 per cent lower at S$1.25 on Tuesday."
2023-02-15,S-Reits take post-Budget hit; impact on developers mixed,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/s-reits-take-post-budget-hit-impact-developers-mixed,"SINGAPORE-LISTED property-related counters finished in a sea of red on Wednesday (Feb 15), as investors processed the latest Budget moves, including a higher Buyer’s Stamp Duty (BSD) and more housing grants.

The changes are expected to affect 60 per cent of non-residential properties and may hit harder in the en bloc market as well as impact big-ticket, billion-dollar deals.

Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (Reits) and property developers took a beating during the Wednesday trading session, while property agencies were mixed before ending lower.
CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U +2.26% was down 2 per cent to S$1.92, while Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust : N2IU +3.65% fell 2.9 per cent to S$1.64. Other Reits with industrial, logistics and office portfolio properties also finished the day lower.
OCBC Investment Research said the changes in BSD and Additional Conveyance Duties for Buyers (ACDB) could potentially have a negative impact on S-Reits with exposure to Singapore, especially the pure-play Singapore-focused Reits, given that they would need to incur a higher capital outlay in the acquisition of non-residential properties.

Property developer City Developments Limited : C09 +2.14% fell as much as 3.4 per cent shortly after the market opened. It closed 3.2 per cent lower at S$7.87. The same downtrend was observed for UOL : U14 +1.25%, which was down 1.3 per cent at S$6.82, as well as GuocoLand : F17 +0.65%, which lost 2.5 per cent to close at S$1.59.
DBS Group Research sees minimal impact from higher BSD for property developers, while JPMorgan believes the increases in taxes are manageable. Transaction velocity will also see little impact as demand drivers for such properties persist.
Property agency PropNex : OYY +0.58% closed 2.4 per cent lower at S$1.63, while Apac Realty : CLN +1.96% finished 0.8 per cent lower at S$0.615, despite seeing some gains during the trading session. DBS said the additional housing grants announced during the Budget should help boost demand for resale flats, which should be mildly positive for property agencies.
In his Budget speech on Tuesday, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said the government will introduce a higher marginal BSD for higher-value residential and non-residential properties. The change takes effect on Feb 15.

For non-residential properties, the portion of the property’s value in excess of S$1 million and up to S$1.5 million will be taxed at 4 per cent, while that in excess of S$1.5 million will be taxed at 5 per cent – up from the current tax rate of 3 per cent.

Correspondingly, the ACDB, which applies to qualifying acquisitions of equity interest in property holding entities, will be raised to as much as 46 per cent, from up to 44 per cent."
2023-02-16,"ESR-Logos Reit launches S$300 million equity fundraising for potential acquisitions, AEIs",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/esr-logos-reit-launches-s300-million-equity-fundraising-potential-acquisitions,"ESR-Logos Real Estate Investment Trust’s : J91U -1.82% (Reit) manager has proposed a S$300 million equity fundraising exercise to fund future acquisitions, redevelopments and asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs).

This will be accomplished through a private placement and preferential offering, which will raise S$150 million each, the Reit’s manager said on Thursday (Feb 16).

It plans to issue between 447.8 million and 454.5 million new private placement units, at an issue price ranging between S$0.33 and S$0.335.
This represents a discount of between 4.3 per cent and 5.8 per cent to ESR-Logos Reit’s volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of S$0.3502 per unit for all trades done on Feb 15, the day before the placement agreement was signed.

Each new preferential offering unit will be issued at a S$0.005 discount to the private placement price, representing a discount of between 5.8 per cent and 7.2 per cent to the VWAP.

Based on pro forma estimates, had the proposed equity fundraising been completed on Dec 31, 2022, the Reit’s net asset value per share would have decreased to S$0.359 from S$0.364. Its aggregate leverage would also drop to 38 per cent from 41.8 per cent.
The manager will use around S$293 million in gross proceeds from the fundraising towards future potential acquisitions and finance redevelopment or AEIs of ESR-Logos Reit’s properties. The remaining S$7 million will be used to pay fees and expenses incurred by the Reit in connection with the fundraising exercise.

In connection with the private placement, the manager plans to declare an advanced distribution of between S$0.00426 and S$0.0047, to ensure fairness to holders of existing units. This will apply to the period from Jan 1, up until the day before the private placement units are issued – estimated to be on or around Feb 27.

The manager also said it will issue a circular concerning the preferential offering’s details, and seek unitholder approval for the preferential offering at an extraordinary general meeting to be convened.

Citigroup Global Markets Singapore, DBS and UOB are the joint bookrunners and underwriters for the private placement. RHB Singapore branch has been appointed the sole financial advisor and coordinator for the preferential offering.

ESR-Logos Reit ended flat at S$0.35 on Wednesday. The manager called for a trading halt on Thursday morning before the market opened."
2023-02-22,Investors may need deeper pockets as Reits raise cash for expansion,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/investors-may-need-deeper-pockets-reits-raise-cash-expansion,"IT IS not an easy time to be a real estate investment trust (Reit) manager. It could soon become just as difficult for Reit investors, particularly those without cash to spare.

Last year was one of the worst years for Singapore-listed Reits (S-Reits), as interest rate fears and geopolitical uncertainty fuelled a sell-off.

But with signs of an easing pace of interest rate hikes and buoyancy over China’s reopening post-Covid, S-Reits raced to a stellar start in 2023.
In January, the iEdge S-Reit Index posted 7.1 per cent in total returns – outpacing the 3.5 per cent total returns of the Straits Times Index.

That optimism might have lulled S-Reit managers and investors to believe that the worst is over – and that it is time to ramp up efforts to capture growth.

Here, however, the interests of Reit managers and investors diverge. For managers, this is the time to raise money and stuff the war chests for potential acquisitions ahead. For investors, however, now may not be the best of times to cough up extra cash.
The apprehension is understandable, given that stubbornly high US inflation data continues to feed interest rate jitters.

A case in point is ESR-Logos Reit : J91U -1.82%, which last week became the first S-Reit to launch an equity fundraising in 2023.

The Reit manager on Feb 16 proposed to raise S$300 million – through both a private placement and preferential offering that will raise S$150 million each – to fund future acquisitions, redevelopments and asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs).

The private placement to new and existing institutional investors was three times subscribed at S$0.33 apiece – at the bottom of the issue price range.

The issue price represents a 5.8 per cent discount to the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of S$0.3502 for all trades in units of ESR-Logos Reit on the Singapore Exchange on the day before it announced the equity fundraising.

The price for its preferential offering to all existing investors has been fixed at S$0.325 apiece – at a S$0.005 discount to the private placement price – and will be launched if the resolution passes through at the next extraordinary general meeting. The price also represents a 7.2 per cent discount to its VWAP.

On the face of it, ESR-Logos Reit’s equity fundraising is a good move. The infusion of cash should de-risk its balance sheet and position it for potential accretive acquisitions.

Post-equity fundraising, ESR-Logos Reit’s gearing will fall to 38 per cent – from 41.8 per cent as at end-December 2022.

The Reit manager has also earmarked S$450 million of non-core assets to be divested over the next 12 months, which will mean its gearing could drop further to 32.3 per cent. If all goes according to plan, ESR-Reit will have a debt headroom of S$1.1 billion (based on the gearing limit of 45 per cent).

Aggregate leverage of its industrial S-Reit peers such as Mapletree Industrial Trust : ME8U +2.29%, CapitaLand Ascendas Reit : A17U +3.03%, Mapletree Logistics Trust : M44U +2.58% and Aims Apac Reit : O5RU +0.78% stood at between 36.3 per cent and 37.4 per cent.

Investors in ESR-Logos Reit haven’t taken so well to the news, though.

After it announced the close of the private placement exercise on Feb 17, units of ESR-Logos Reit fell 5.7 per cent or S$0.02 to close at S$0.33 – the same as the private placement issue price.

Investors reacted similarly to the fundraising exercise of Hong Kong-listed Link Reit, the largest Reit in Asia by market value.

Link Reit units tumbled 12.8 per cent on Feb 13 after the Reit manager announced a HK$19.3 billion (S$3.3 billion) rights offering to bankroll expansions.

This fall came after Link Reit on Feb 10 said it will issue as many as 437.7 million units on the basis of one for every five existing units.

The Reit, which in December 2022 bought Jurong Point and Swing By @ Thomson Plaza from NTUC unit Mercatus Co-operative for S$2.16 billion, said it will use the proceeds to repay existing debts and pursue investment opportunities.

The manager expects its net gearing ratio to decrease to below 20 per cent with the rights offering.

Both ESR-Logos Reit and Link Reit may have given themselves a first-mover advantage that could be critical ahead of a potential upturn in the market. And more Reits may now want to follow in their footsteps.

For investors who like a particular Reit, fundraising is an opportunity to amass more units at a discount.

But some investors may now begin to approach the Reit sector with some caution, for fear that more Reits may call upon them for cash."
2023-02-22,Google to give up part of premises leased at FLCT’s Alexandra Technopark from Feb 2024,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/google-give-part-premises-leased-flcts-alexandra-technopark-feb,"Commercial Trust’s : BUOU +0.93% (FLCT) Alexandra Technopark property from Feb 20, 2024, the real estate investment trust (Reit) manager said in a filing on Wednesday (Feb 22).

The manager said the tech giant has exercised its contractual right to surrender a portion of its premises that it leases.

The premises to be surrendered constitutes approximately 1.7 per cent of FLCT’s gross rental income (GRI) for the month ended Dec 31, 2022.

According to its latest business update for the quarter ended December, Google is FLCT’s second-largest portfolio tenant, accounting for 4.1 per cent of the Reit’s total GRI.

Alexandra Technopark accounted for 9.8 per cent of FLCT’s portfolio value as at end December.

Occupancy at Alexandra Technopark had risen to 94.1 per cent as at end December, from 93.4 per cent as at end September.
The Reit manager said it will continue to carry out proactive leasing initiatives and asset management strategies for the commercial property.

It added that Google’s partial exit from Alexandra Technopark in February 2024 is not expected to have an impact on FLCT’s distribution per unit for the financial year ending Sep 30, 2023.

Units of FLCT fell 0.8 per cent or S$0.01 to S$1.24 on Wednesday, before the announcement."
2023-02-24,Sabana Reit’s independent directors recommend unitholders accept Volare’s partial offer,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/sabana-reits-independent-directors-recommend-unitholders-accept,"THE independent directors of the manager of Sabana Industrial Reit : M1GU -1.28% (Sabana Reit) have skipped the appointment of an independent financial adviser (IFA) and recommended unitholders accept the partial offer from substantial shareholder Volare Group.

The Swiss group, which holds a 5.4 per cent stake in Sabana Reit, had made a voluntary conditional partial offer of S$0.465 per unit in cash for 10 per cent of the units that it did not already own.

The partial offer will close at 5.30 pm on Mar 10.
The manager of Sabana Reit had earlier declared distribution per unit (DPU) of S$0.0146 for the second half of FY2022, which will be paid on Mar 27 after the books closure date on Feb 7.

As the closing date of the offer will be after the declared books closure date of H2 DPU, the ex-distribution offer price will be S$0.4504.

“The independent directors have not appointed an IFA to advise on the partial offer, and have instead consulted a duly licensed financial adviser on the financial terms of the partial offer,” the manager of the real estate investment trust (Reit) said in a circular to unitholders on Friday (Feb 24).
Among the key considerations in recommending unitholders accept the partial offer, the independent directors noted that the offer price is at a premium of 9.4 per cent above the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of Sabana Reit units on the day the partial offer was announced.

The offer price is also at premiums of between 5.7 per cent and 15.4 per cent to the historical VWAP of the units over the last one-month, three-month, six-month, one-year, two-year, three-year and five-year periods up to the partial offer announcement date.

The independent directors also noted that the offer price implies a price-to-net asset value (P/NAV) ratio of 0.87 times for Sabana Reit units.

This represents premiums of between 3.6 per cent and 11.5 per cent to Sabana Reit’s historical average trading P/NAV ratios in the last one-year, two-year and five-year periods up to the partial offer announcement date.

The P/NAV ratio implied in the offer price is also close to the average P/NAV ratio of 0.88 times for peers such as Aims Apac Reit : O5RU +1.56% and Daiwa House Logistics Trust : DHLU 0%, the independent directors said.

Activist investor Quarz Capital earlier this week issued an open letter asking the management and board of Sabana Reit not to “waste unitholders’ monies” by appointing an IFA to evaluate the partial offer from Volare Group.

Under the Takeover Code, there is no requirement for the directors to obtain competent independent advice if a partial offer does not result in the offeror and its concert parties holding 30 per cent or more in the offeree.

Units of Sabana Reit closed 1.2 per cent or S$0.005 higher at S$0.425 on Friday, before the announcement."
2023-02-28,Brokers’ take: RHB downgrades IReit Global to ‘neutral’ as leasing risks persist,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/brokers-take-rhb-downgrades-ireit-global-neutral-leasing-risks-persist,"RHB Research downgraded its call on IReit Global : UD1U 0% to “neutral” from “buy”, lowering its target price to S$0.55 from S$0.63, on expectations of lower distribution per unit (DPU) in the near term due to declining occupancy.

This came after the real estate investment trust’s (Reit) results for H2 of FY2022 and the full year missed RHB’s estimates due to higher costs, and lower occupancy mainly because of a vacant Darmstadt Campus after its sole tenant moved out in end-November 2022.

In a report on Tuesday (Feb 28), analyst Vijay Natarajan noted that backfilling of the Darmstadt Campus was “rather slow”, attributing the lack of leasing progress to a weak economic outlook and higher supply in the locality.
He also highlighted concerns over the Reit’s Berlin Campus, whose sole tenant’s lease is due to expire in mid-2024.

“It is uncertain at this juncture if the tenant will continue to stay,” said the analyst.

“As the asset is significantly under-rented there is potential upside if it re-lets, yet this may result in a sharp drop in short-term income during backfilling period as well as a need to pump in higher capital expenditure.”
To factor in expected lower occupancy in the near term, RHB cut its FY2023 DPU forecast by 4 per cent and FY2024 forecast by 6 per cent.

Nonetheless, Natarajan said he continues to like the Reit for its strong balance sheet, as its gearing remains the lowest among its Singapore Reit peers at about 32 per cent. This would provide debt headroom to “pounce on good opportunities”.

In his view, IReit Global’s fully hedged debt profile until end-2026 means it will be minimally impacted by rate increases.

The analyst added that IReit’s portfolio leases are “pegged to step-up rents and CPI (consumer price index) indexation”. Therefore, there may be an upside for the Reit from current high inflation levels in its key markets.

As at 9.51 am on Tuesday, units of IReit Global were up S$0.01 or 1.9 per cent at S$0.525."
2022-11-15,"Dasin Retail Trust 9M revenue falls 7.8% on China Covid-19 curbs, higher rental rebates",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/dasin-retail-trust-9m-revenue-falls-78-china-covid-19-curbs-higher-rental-rebates,"CHINA-FOCUSED real estate investment trust Dasin Retail Trust on Monday (Nov 14) reported a 7.8 per cent drop in revenue to S$70.7 million for the nine months ended September (9M2022), from S$76.7 million the year before.

Net property income for 9M2022 slipped 8.3 per cent to S$55.2 million, from S$60.3 million in the corresponding period last year.

The trustee-manager said the declines were due to the temporary closure of some malls and trade sectors by the government due to Covid-19-related restrictions.
Rental rebates to tenants in 9M2022 were about three times higher than the previous year, the trustee-manager said.

It added that strict travel restrictions and social distancing measures also caused ""stifling spending in China's consumer market and weak consumer sentiments"", resulting in lower revenue contribution from all its properties.

""We believe that the performance of the malls will improve with the easing of movement restrictions but it would be challenging as it may still take some time for the consumer sentiment to reach full recovery,"" said Wang Qiu, CEO of the trustee-manager of Dasin Retail Trust.
The trustee-manager said it has been working closely with its lenders for the refinancing exercise and exploring potential proposals, including the disposal of certain assets, partnership with strategic investors, and alternative fundraising activities.

It added that it has commenced discussions with more than one leading Chinese enterprise for potential strategic investments.

Dasin Retail Trust has some S$756.4 million of facilities due by the end of this year.

Its gearing ratio stood at 40.4 per cent as at end-September.

""While placing our great priority working towards the completion of the refinancing exercises, we continue with our efforts in optimising tenant mix and introducing trending brands to enhance customers' shopping experience,"" Wang said.

Units of Dasin Retail Trust closed flat at S$0.27 on Monday, before the announcement."
2023-03-02,Sasseur Reit could be worth a closer look amid China’s reopening,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/sasseur-reit-could-be-worth-closer-look-amid-chinas-reopening,"INVESTORS who bought into the initial public offerings (IPOs) of the four China-focused property trusts backed by Chinese sponsors that listed here between 2015 and 2018 would be licking their wounds. 

Based on unit prices as at Mar 1, BHG Retail Reit : BMGU 0%, Dasin Retail Trust : CEDU 0% and EC World Reit : BWCU 0% traded between 39 per cent and 75 per cent below their IPO prices.

Among the quartet, Sasseur Real Estate Investment Trust : CRPU +0.76% traded closest to its IPO price - at S$0.77 per unit, or 4 per cent versus its IPO price of S$0.80.
Investors may do well to take a look at this real estate investment trust (Reit) to ride on what is arguably 2023’s mega investment story - China’s reopening after abandoning its pursuit of a zero-Covid strategy.

Last year was tough for Sasseur Reit, which owns four outlet malls in China. Recurrent Covid-19 outbreaks and related restrictions weighed on consumer confidence in China. Covid curbs led to shortened operating hours and temporary closures of the trust’s outlet malls.

Sasseur Reit’s distribution per unit (DPU) fell 7.8 per cent in 2022 as outlet sales dropped 15.5 per cent year on year (y-o-y). Meanwhile, the trust’s net asset value (NAV) per share declined 12.1 per cent from end-2021 to S$0.87 as at end-2022.
While valuations of investment properties in local currency terms were stable, the trust’s property valuations in Singapore dollars were hit by the renminbi weakening by about 9 per cent against the Singapore dollar.

Compelling valuation

Still, Sasseur Reit’s DPU for 2022 is broadly in line with that achieved pre-pandemic in 2019. Based on unit price as at Mar 1, Sasseur Reit traded at historical DPU yield of 8.5 per cent and discount to NAV of 11 per cent.

Sasseur Reit’s DPU yield is higher than that of Frasers Centrepoint Trust : J69U +1.91% (FCT), which is a large mall owner in Singapore. Based on unit price as at Mar 1 and last financial year DPU, FCT traded at yield of 5.5 per cent.

As at Mar 1, CapitaLand China Trust : AU8U +1.17% (CLCT), which owns malls, business parks and logistics parks in China, traded at DPU yield of 6.4 per cent, based on DPU for 2022, and discount to end-2022 NAV of 14 per cent.

Compared to the Singapore five-year government bond yield of nearly 3.4 per cent per annum as at end-February, Sasseur Reit’s DPU yield offers a positive spread of over 510 basis points.

China reopening play

Crucially, Sasseur Reit should enjoy strong DPU growth due to China’s reopening. 

Many Asian destinations, including Singapore, are hoping to get a boost from welcoming Chinese visitors in large numbers. But the effects of China’s reopening may be felt most in China itself. 

China’s economy may grow by 5.2 per cent this year, up from 3 per cent in 2022, according to the International Monetary Fund. 

The Chinese economy should benefit from pent-up consumer demand, as the household savings rate averaged 33 per cent during the pandemic period Q1 2020 to Q3 2022, compared to the 2015-2019 average of under 30 per cent.

There are promising signs of consumer spending rising in China. Over this year’s Chinese New Year holiday period, revenue from domestic tourism rose 30 per cent y-o-y and restaurant revenue was up nearly 25 per cent y-o-y. 

Sasseur Reit benefits if sales at its outlet malls located in Chongqing, Hefei and Kunming grow, as it has income that is linked to sales at these malls. 

China’s retail landscape is competitive. Still, Sasseur Reit brings a differentiated offering. Its outlet malls are large in scale, offering choice to consumers. The properties are also well-designed, which enhances the shopping experience. And consumers can buy competitively-priced branded goods at these outlet malls.

The outlet malls have an active membership programme that helps build customer loyalty. The number of VIP members in Sasseur Reit’s portfolio has grown by a compound annual growth rate of nearly 39 per cent between end-2018 and end-2022. 

Over the longer term, efforts by Chinese policymakers to grow discretionary spending power for the middle-income population bode well for Sasseur Reit as its outlet malls target such customers.

Balance sheet strength

The other key reason to like Sasseur Reit’s prospects is that the trust has a strong balance sheet. New loan commitments to refinance outstanding loans due in March have been secured. And the trust has no significant refinancing requirements until 2026.

Sasseur Reit’s aggregate leverage was 27.6 per cent as at end-2022. It can take on around S$791 million more in debt to fund new acquisitions, based on the 50 per cent leverage limit for Reits. Aggregate leverage refers to the ratio of a trust’s total debt to its total assets.

Perhaps Sasseur Reit will soon make a yield-accretive acquisition of an outlet mall in Xian or Guiyang, where the trust has right of refusal from its sponsor Sasseur Group. 

Founded by Xu Rongcan, Sasseur Group has 30 years experience focusing on outlet operations in China. Besides the malls held in the Reit, the sponsor has 12 operating outlet malls in China as well as two upcoming ones.

Local Reit investors tend to have a home market bias, preferring Singapore-centric trusts and/or those that have strong local groups as sponsors. In a Reit market where investors are spoilt for choice and more demanding amid higher interest rates, Sasseur Reit’s manager could face a tough task in winning over more investors.

China has started its Reit market with infrastructure Reits. If Reits owning commercial buildings start to feature big in China’s Reit market, Sasseur Reit could potentially move its listing from Singapore to China to seek better valuation.

Sasseur Reit rides on favourable trends. Will investors warmly embrace the Reit’s story? The answer to that may in turn impact Singapore’s continued ability to draw Reits that own overseas assets to list here."
2023-03-01,Nearly half of S-Reits suffer DPU declines in H2 – more pain for investors lies ahead,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/nearly-half-s-reits-suffer-dpu-declines-h2-more-pain-investors-lies-ahead,"NEARLY half of the Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) have reported a year-on-year (y-o-y) decline in distribution per unit (DPU) for the latest period ended Dec 31, 2022.

But even as S-Reit managers – and investors – keep their fingers crossed for an end to interest-rate hikes, the data suggests it might get worse before it gets better: nearly two-thirds of the real estate investment trusts (Reits) have seen their DPU retreat compared to the preceding quarter or half-year periods.

This implies that while S-Reits are still doing better than they did in the previous year, momentum is not on the side of the optimists – and DPU looks headed for further decline ahead.


Of the 35 S-Reits that reported gross revenue figures for the latest quarter or half-year period, 26 saw an improvement – mostly due to the revival of economic activity with the reopening of borders in most countries.

Among the 36 that reported net property income (NPI) data, 25 did better year on year. Much of these gains, however, were decimated by higher financing costs amid rising interest rates.

Of the 34 S-Reits that reported DPU figures, 16 saw improvements, while another 16 posted declines, and two others had DPUs unchanged from the previous year.
Smoothed out over the full year, the figures were more encouraging: 25 out of 29 reported higher gross revenue for FY2022, 24 out of 30 saw higher NPI, and 15 out of 29 posted higher DPU.

“Plateauing rates, an appreciating Singapore dollar (SGD) and reopening of borders globally add to our positive view of S-Reits,” said Maybank analysts Krishna Guha and Li Jialin.

“That said, sticky inflation and a higher-for-longer thematic, a sluggish SGD bond market, potential recession and tight spreads make us pause,” they added.
Losing momentum
On the face of it, the figures are not half bad. But the slowdown in the latest period might be cause for concern.

Only 19 out of 32 S-Reits reported higher gross revenue compared to the preceding half or quarter. And of the 33 that reported NPI figures, only 15 saw improvements half-on-half (h-o-h) or quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q).

More alarmingly, only a third – or 11 out of 33 S-Reits – saw DPU improvements h-o-h or q-o-q. In contrast, 20 of these S-Reits saw their DPUs slip compared to the preceding period.

For example, Mapletree Logistics Trust : M44U +2.58% (MLT) recorded a seemingly stellar third quarter, with an 8 per cent y-o-y increase in gross revenue to S$180.2 million on the back of accretive acquisitions, while NPI rose 7.3 per cent to S$157.2 million.

MLT’s Q3 available DPU was 1.9 per cent higher at S$0.02227, including income support of S$616,000. Excluding income support, Q3 DPU would be S$0.02214.

However, MLT’s Q3 figures were lower than the gross revenue of S$183.9 million and NPI of S$160 million in Q2 ended Sep 30, 2022.

The latest DPU was also lower than Q2’s available DPU of S$0.02248, including income support of S$974,000. Excluding income support, Q2’s DPU would have been S$0.02228 – higher than that of the latest quarter ended December.

“Notwithstanding the attractiveness of a regional network of warehouses in trade and consumption-oriented geographies, the near-term outlook is tempered by foreign exchange volatility, new supply and a difficult environment for accretive deals,” Guha said, as he downgraded his recommendation on MLT to “hold”, from “buy” previously.

Another examples of S-Reits that performed better y-o-y but declined h-o-h are CapitaLand India Trust : CY6U 0% (Clint) and Starhill Global Reit : P40U +1.04%.

Meanwhile, the hospitality and healthcare S-Reits were among the best performers in the latest period.

For example, CapitaLand Ascott Trust : HMN +2.82% (Clas) reported a 47 per cent increase in distribution per stapled security (DPS) to S$0.0333 for the half year ended December, from S$0.0227 the previous year.

Including adjustments for one-off items as well as a divestment gain of S$25 million, adjusted DPS would have near doubled to S$0.03 in H2, from S$0.0151 in the year-ago period.

Clas’ H2 revenue climbed 69 per cent to S$353.8 million, with revenue per available unit increasing 81 per cent on the back of the international travel recovery.

For the full year, Clas’ DPS was up 31 per cent to S$0.0567, while revenue was 58 per cent higher at S$621.2 million.

Similarly, hospitality peers such as Ara US Hospitality Trust : XZL 0%, CDL Hospitality Trusts : J85 0% and Far East Hospitality Trust : Q5T +0.85% all reported improvements in gross revenue, NPI and DPU for their respective second-half and full-year periods.

On the healthcare front, Parkway Life Reit : C2PU 0% led the way with a 2.7 per cent increase in DPU to S$0.0732 for the second half ended December, compared to S$0.0713 in the previous year.

H2 gross revenue grew 14.2 per cent to S$69.8 million, while NPI was 18 per cent higher at S$65.8 million.

For the full year, Parkway Life Reit’s DPU was 2.1 per cent higher at S$0.1438, with gross revenue up 7.7 per cent to S$130 million and NPI increasing 9.6 per cent to S$121.9 million.

The improvements were attributed to higher rent from recently acquired properties and the group’s Singapore hospitals under new master lease agreements, as well as adjusted hospital revenue for Parkway East Hospital’s 15th year lease, which outperformed its minimum guaranteed rent.

On the other hand, office S-Reits were among the worst performers in the latest round of results.

Of the 6 that reported their H2 results, only one – Keppel Reit : K71U +1.2% – managed to eke out positive distributable income and DPU growth year on year.

However, this was only due to a special S$10 million anniversary distribution for the period. Distributable income from operations, without the anniversary distribution, would have been 3.8 per cent lower in H2.

Results were mixed across the other sub-sectors.

Some of the better performing S-Reits that reported both y-o-y and h-o-h improvements across gross revenue, NPI and DPU include CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U +1.69%, CapitaLand Ascendas Reit : A17U +2.65%, ESR-Logos Reit : J91U 0% and Keppel DC Reit : AJBU +1.47%."

CLCT has generated six-month total returns of 11.4 per cent as at Mar 6, assuming dividends were reinvested in the security. This is significantly better than the negative 8.6 per cent average total returns from its peers, and makes it the top performer among S-Reits over this period.
Meanwhile, Sasseur Reit’s total returns of 5.3 per cent also put it in fourth position, behind First Ship Lease Trust and Keppel DC Reit.
Analysts believe that the rebounding Chinese economy would continue to benefit these counters, even though challenges from rising interest rates could still weigh on the broader Reits segment.

Optimism from China’s reopening has been one of the key drivers of CLCT and Sasseur Reit’s outperformance over the last six months, said Vijay Natarajan, analyst at RHB Group.
“These two Reits are predominantly retail sector-focused and thus among the major beneficiaries of removal of Covid-related restrictions,” he added.

“(They) have also benefited from strong sponsor backing, prudent balance sheet and debt profiles which have helped them to navigate through the challenging funding environment for China-focused real estate players (over the) last two years.”

CGS-CIMB analyst Lock Mun Yee also noted that China’s reopening could result in increased mobility within the country and improving retail sentiment. The brokerage currently has an “add” rating for Sasseur Reit with a target price of S$1.00.

“We think the post-Covid normalisation would continue to provide tailwinds to Sasseur Reit with improved shopper traffic and tenant sales outlook,” she said. “This is in addition to Sasseur’s EMA (entrusted management agreement) rental structure which provides a stable rental base.”

Meanwhile, Derek Tan from DBS Group Research said the reopening of China could be positive for the China-focused Reits in terms of operational outlook with lesser rent rebates. Together with higher tenant confidence, this implies that “reversionary prospects” will likely improve.
DBS has “buy” calls on both CLCT and Sasseur Reit, with target prices of S$1.45 and S$1.05 respectively.

Recent economic data from China shows that activity has been rebounding since the government lifted its strict Covid-19 restrictions in December. Last week, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index in February stood at 52.6, compared to 50.1 in January. This comes above the 50-point mark that indicates an expansion in activity.

But the growth outlook for the country also remains uncertain amid global headwinds from high inflation and interest rates.

On Sunday (Mar 5), China set a modest economic growth target of around 5 per cent for 2023 – its lowest in decades. This comes after the economy grew 3 per cent last year, missing the official target of around 5.5 per cent for 2022.

While Sasseur and CLCT have outperformed over the last six months, the three smaller China-focused S-Reits on the SGX have not fared as well.

BHG Retail Reit : BMGU 0%, Dasin Retail Trust : CEDU 0% and EC World Reit : BWCU 0% have generated negative total returns over the past six months. As at Mar 6, Dasin Retail Trust and EC World Reit rank among the worst-performing S-Reits, with six-month total returns of negative 30.7 per cent and negative 36 per cent, respectively.

“For Dasin and EC World, there were uncertainties due to their ability to refinance their debt which has resulted in the equity markets pricing in this risk,” Tan said.

RHB’s Natarajan also noted that, until these refinancing issues are fully resolved, he doesn’t expect investors to turn their attention towards these Reits.

“For BHG Retail Reit, it has successfully completed its refinancing, but it faces liquidity issues and is thinly traded thus drawing limited investor attention,” he added. The counter’s unit price has fallen 4 per cent in the past six months.

The broader pool of S-Reits has also faced recent price pressures amid renewed fears of sticky inflation and prolonged high interest rates. Similar to other S-Reits, CLCT and Sasseur Reit have seen their unit prices slip in the past month.

CGS-CIMB’s Lock said: “The performance of S-Reits was impacted by the prospect of potentially further rate hikes and higher rates for longer as US inflation data remains hot.”

Meanwhile, Tan also noted that the unit price pressure has come amid a spike in 10-year bond yields recently, and the China S-Reits have not been spared.

“As a subsector, (the) outlook remains more optimistic as operational conditions thaw within China itself,” he said.

“We have observed in past rate hike cycles that share prices tend to bottom out two months before a rate hike pause and return positively over the next six to 12 months after a pause in rate increases. I believe that prices should bottom from then.”

Natarajan added that some of the recent weakness could be due to some of the early exuberance from China’s reopening fading away.

“The tailwinds for China-focused S-Reits are closely tied to the pace of economic recovery (post-reopening) and rebound in consumer spending,” he said.

“China is among the few remaining economies with loosening interest rate policy as well as a step-up in government policy support to restart the economy, (which) could be a key catalyst for the sector.”

2023-03-08,EC World Reit releases more funds from escrow for loan repayments,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/ec-world-reit-releases-more-funds-escrow-loan-repayments,"MORE funds deposited by its sponsor for loan repayment have been released from escrow to help pay for some of the Reit’s outstanding mandatory repayments, EC World Real Estate Investment Trust’s : BWCU 0% (Reit) manager said on Tuesday (Mar 7).

Around S$5.7 million and US$1.9 million were used to partially repay existing offshore bank loans on Mar 2, while 29.3 million yuan (S$5.7 million) was used to repay existing onshore bank loans partially on Mar 7, the manager said.

The outstanding amount of relevant deposits stands at 29.9 million yuan, which the onshore facility agent continues to hold in escrow. The deposits held in escrow with the offshore facility agent have been fully utilised.
As at Mar 7, the Reit has some S$57.7 million in offshore bank loans and S$81.2 million in onshore bank loans to repay.

Using a portion of the deposits would enable the Reit to save on interest payments which would otherwise be incurred on the outstanding loan amounts, said the manager.

It also noted there is no certainty or assurance that the lenders will consent to the extension of the mandatory repayment deadline beyond Feb 28.
Until this consent is obtained, EC World Reit is in breach of its mandatory repayment obligations, which triggers an event of default under the existing offshore and onshore bank loans.

To date, around 50 per cent of existing onshore bank loan lenders and 75 per cent of lenders of existing offshore bank loans have agreed to the Reit’s new repayment plan. The manager said it will provide an update if all lenders have given their approval, or if any lender has rejected the new repayment plan.

Previously, the manager released about 198.9 million yuan from escrow to partially repay the outstanding mandatory repayment of its offshore and onshore bank loans.

EC World Reit units closed S$0.01 or 3 per cent higher at S$0.34 on Tuesday."
2023-03-09,Diversification is key as healthcare S-Reits adjust to end of pandemic: analysts,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/diversification-key-healthcare-s-reits-adjust-end-pandemic,"SINGAPORE-LISTED real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) with healthcare assets must diversify strategies to capture new growth pillars as the healthcare sector normalises and the world returns to a post-Covid “business as usual” situation, market watchers said.

The last two years have been good years for healthcare-related stocks in general. In the Singapore market, Parkway Life Reit : C2PU 0% (PLife Reit) has significantly outperformed most of its S-Reit peers.

While hospitality Reits dealt with the drying up of tourist dollars, retail Reits faced down empty malls and even office Reits worried about rental renewals as employees worked from home, Parkway Life enjoyed steady income over the pandemic period.
PLife Reit has generated total returns of 10.2 per cent in the year to Tuesday (Mar 7).

In comparison, the overall Reit market here, represented by the iEdge S-Reit Index, has generated total returns of 4 per cent over the same period, while the benchmark Straits Times Index has returned 0.1 per cent.

The edge that PLife Reit enjoyed may, however, be coming to an end.
Singapore on Feb 13 reverted its disease outbreak response system condition (Dorscon) level from yellow to green, which indicates that a disease is mild and poses minimal disruption to daily life. Most countries – including China, which had until recently imposed strict restrictions amid a tough zero-Covid policy – have also reopened their borders.

While expected to be a shot in the arm for sectors such as hospitality and retail, Dorscon Green could put the brakes on the healthcare sector’s trajectory.

New growth pillars
To its credit, PLife Reit has been building up its portfolio to grow its income.

One of Asia’s largest listed Reits by asset size, it acquired five nursing homes in the Hokkaido region and the Greater Tokyo region last year for a total of 5.4 billion yen (S$55.5 million).

“PLife Reit’s asset recycling activities in Japan nursing homes are still ongoing,” said DBS analysts Rachel Tan and Derek Tan, noting that these activities have been “sporadic”. The Reit in early 2021 divested its non-core industrial property, P-Life Matsudo – the only pharmaceutical product distributing and manufacturing facility within its Japan portfolio.

“With the recent acquisitions, we believe its asset recycling exercise will continue to drive growth ahead, given its successful track record,” the analysts added. “But the timing remains uncertain.”

They see a “potential injection” of Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital into PLife Reit’s portfolio, which already includes three other Singapore hospitals: Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Gleneagles Hospital and Parkway East Hospital.

The three Singapore hospitals account for 65.3 per cent of its portfolio by asset value, with the Japan nursing homes making up 34.4 per cent. The Reit also owns some strata-titled units in a medical office building in Malaysia.

The Reit has right of first refusal over Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital from its sponsor IHH Healthcare : Q0F +1.19%.

In addition to the ongoing recycling of its nursing homes properties in Japan and the acquisition pipeline from its sponsor, the manager of PLife Reit is looking to build a “third pillar” for the next phase of growth.

“The management continues to explore opportunities in developed countries with a mature healthcare market and believes that there could be potential options in Australia and Europe,” the DBS analysts said.

Value in Japan
Another healthcare Reit making a play for Japan is First Reit : AW9U -2.13%, which in September last year bought two nursing homes near the Tokyo and Nagoya city centres for a total purchase consideration of 2.6 billion yen.

This comes after the Reit in March 2022 marked its maiden entry into Japan with the acquisition of 12 nursing homes from its sponsor OUE Lippo Healthcare : 5WA 0% for 24.2 billion yen.

The manager of First Reit noted then that Japan is poised to become the first “super-aged” nation in the world, with more than a third of its population projected to be over the age of 65 by 2040.
First Reit, which has 72.1 per cent of its S$1.15 billion in assets under management (AUM) based in Indonesia, has not done as well as PLife Reit. It generated total returns of 2.5 per cent in the year to date – lower than the S-Reit average.
According to SAC Capital analyst Peggy Mak, First Reit – like many of its S-Reit peers – has been weighed down by concerns over rising interest rates and the resultant impact on its cost of funds and asset valuations.

“But its risk profile has improved with the conclusion of new master leases for the Indonesian assets in late-2021 and the addition of the Japan assets in March 2022,” Mak said in a report.

First Reit’s 14 Japan nursing homes accounted for 25.1 per cent of its AUM as at end December. Its three nursing homes in Singapore account for the remaining 2.8 per cent.

The Reit manager had earlier announced that it intends to pivot into developed markets, which it targets to account for more than half of its portfolio by 2027.

With the easing of cross-border travel restrictions, First Reit said in its latest results announcement that it will continue to carry out what it calls its “2.0 Growth Strategy” to explore accretive opportunities arising from the increasing healthcare demand."
2023-03-15,SVB collapse puts spotlight on S-Reits’ balance sheets,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/svb-collapse-puts-spotlight-s-reits-balance-sheets,"THE shocking collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) ought to be a wake-up call to investors to pay more attention to the balance sheets of listed companies.

SVB, America’s 16th largest commercial bank, had provided banking services to nearly half of all US venture-backed technology and life-science companies.

But a plan to raise capital and shore up its balance sheet led to a run on the bank. Less than 48 hours following the announcement, it avalanched into the biggest US bank failure since the global financial crisis.
At the heart of SVB’s demise were the interest rate hikes by the United States Federal Reserve, aimed at quelling decades-high inflation rates.

The jump in interest rates dried up the bank deposits of struggling startups amid a venture capital funding drought, as well as an erosion in the value of SVB’s bond portfolio.

The collapse of the California-based lender was sudden and surprising. And the shockwaves were felt as far as Singapore and the rest of Asia, where fears of contagion continue to roil capital markets.
Although markets are now anticipating a slower pace of hikes from central banks seeking to contain a potential contagion, there is widespread anticipation of tougher credit conditions.

This could be troublesome for real estate investment trusts (Reits) – one of the favoured asset classes among investors in Singapore.

Singapore-listed Reits (S-Reits), already wrangling higher financing costs, face a tough year ahead due to increases in aggregate leverage. This metric, also known as the gearing ratio, weighs a Reit’s total debt against its total assets.

The aggregate leverage levels of more than half – 22 out of 40 – of the actively traded S-Reits had risen as of end-2022, compared with the last reported data.

For many of these S-Reits, the higher aggregate leverage was due to a decline in portfolio asset value following the conclusion of year-end property revaluations.

For example, the aggregate leverage of Manulife US Reit : BTOU +4% jumped to 48.8 per cent from 42.5 per cent previously, mainly due to a 10.9 per cent drop in its portfolio valuation.

In contrast, only 15 of the 40 S-Reits reported a decline in gearing ratios; another two were unchanged.

Another S-Reit, Dasin Retail Trust : CEDU -10.53%, has not reported its financial results for the latest financial period. The trustee-manager asked to be allowed to announce its FY2022 results by end-April 2023.

S-Reits are required to maintain aggregate leverage at under 50 per cent if the minimum adjusted interest coverage ratio is at 2.5 times.

If the interest coverage ratio falls below 2.5 times, the maximum allowable aggregate leverage is at 45 per cent.

Besides Manulife US Reit, another S-Reit that has seen its aggregate leverage rise beyond 45 per cent is Elite Commercial Reit. : MXNU 0%

The UK-focused Reit reported a gearing ratio of 45.8 per cent as at end-December, up from 41.9 per cent as at end-June.

Elite Commercial Reit’s portfolio valuation fell 6.8 per cent year on year to £466.2 million (S$763.6 million) as at Dec 31, 2022. This was also 9.9 per cent lower than its mid-year valuation as at end June.

Meanwhile, Lippo Malls Indonesia Retail Trust : D5IU 0% (LMIRT), whose gearing ratio is at 44.6 per cent, has nearly hit the limit as its interest coverage ratio stood at just 2.3 times.

The Reit manager attributed the increase in aggregate leverage, from 43.7 per cent previously, to the depreciation of the Indonesian rupiah against the Singapore dollar.

Fitch Ratings last week downgraded LMIRT’s issuer default rating – for the second time in three weeks – to “CCC”, as it continues to worry over refinancing risks.
Currently, three S-Reits have aggregate leverages below 30 per cent: Sasseur Reit : CRPU +0.76% (27.6 per cent), Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust : BUOU 0% (27.9 per cent) and Paragon Reit : SK6U +1.23% (29.8 per cent).

If the Reit managers play their cards right, this could provide an invaluable advantage amid uncertain times.

SVB has reminded us that even big companies can fold almost overnight. Did someone say distressed sales?"
2023-03-15,CICT unit issues HK$755 million fixed rate notes due 2033 priced at 4.85%,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/cict-unit-issues-hk755-million-fixed-rate-notes-due-2033-priced-485,"CAPITALAND Integrated Commercial Trust’s (CICT) wholly-owned subsidiary CMT MTN has issued HK$755 million (S$130 million) worth of fixed rate notes to institutional or sophisticated investors.

The notes will mature on Mar 15, 2033, and will bear interest at a rate of 4.85 per cent per annum, payable annually in arrear.

Proceeds from the notes issue will be used to finance or refinance eligible green projects undertaken by CICT and its subsidiaries in accordance with the group’s green finance framework, the real estate investment trust (Reit) said on Wednesday (Mar 15).

The Singapore Exchange Securities Trading (SGX-ST) has granted approval-in-principle for the listing and quotation of the notes, so the notes will be listed and quoted on the SGX-ST on or about Mar 16, it added.

The notes were issued under the US$3 trillion Euro-Medium Term Note programme which CMT MTN established in 2010, and are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by HSBC Institutional Trust Services, in its capacity as trustee of CICT.

The trustee will also guarantee the issuer’s obligations as it undertakes transactions to swap the Hong Kong dollar proceeds of the notes into Singapore dollar proceeds of about S$132.7 million at a Singapore dollar fixed interest rate of 4.026 per cent per annum.
Moody’s Investors Service assigned the notes a senior unsecured rating of A3. This takes into consideration CICT’s track record of strong access to funding, and has manageable refinancing needs over the next 12 to 15 months due to proactive capital management, Moody’s said in a note.

The rating also incorporates Moody’s expectation that CICT’s earnings will improve over the next 12-18 months because of higher contributions from acquisitions completed last year, it stated.

The ratings agency, meanwhile, gave the notes a “negative” outlook, owing to CICT’s elevated leverage and uncertainty around the trust’s ability to balance deleveraging with its growth strategy.

Units of CICT closed 2.2 per cent or S$0.04 higher at S$1.88 on Wednesday."
2023-03-19,10 S-Reits with lowest gearing ratios average 32% gearing,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/10-s-reits-lowest-gearing-ratios-average-32-gearing,"S-REITs have been in the spotlight over the past week due to recent banking news and ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Mar 21-22.

The majority of traders in the market are expecting another 0.25 percentage point interest rate increase.

A key metric for Reits is the gearing ratio, also known as aggregated leverage, which is a metric closely monitored by investors and often used to access a Reit’s financial leverage.
It is the ratio of a Reit’s total debt to total assets. A lower gearing ratio could point to more capacity to take on more debt when needed, while a higher ratio could lead to credit concerns, especially during an economic downturn.

As of end-February this year, the 40 actively traded S-Reits and Property Trusts had an average gearing ratio of 37.7 per cent, below the regulatory limit of 50 per cent if the minimum interest coverage ratio (ICR) is at least 2.5 times, imposed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).

If the ICR is below 2.5 times, the maximum allowable limit is at 45 per cent. This limit was last increased in April 2020, to provide the sector with more flexibility to manage their capital structure during the pandemic.
Among the 40 trusts, all of them have gearing ratios within regulatory limits and half of them, or 20 trusts, have ratios at or below the sector’s average.

In the first two months of this year, these 20 have generated average total returns of 6.6 per cent, outperforming the sector’s average total returns at 4.0 per cent.

In a recent SGX Research market update in January, which looked at comparative performances and fund flows within the sector since the end of 2021, debt-to-asset ratios have anecdotally held some level of investor influence.

Also, ahead of the US FOMC commencing its Fed Funds Rate tightening on Mar 17, 2022, on average, close to 75 per cent of S-Reits and Property Trusts’ current debts were entered directly in fixed rates or hedged through floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps.

Taking a look at the ICRs available and reported in latest filings, average ICR for the sector stands at around 4.7 times. ICR is used to determine how easily a company can pay interest on its outstanding debt.

It is typically calculated as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) divided by interest expense.

The 10 trusts with the lowest gearing ratios reported are Sasseur Reit : CRPU +0.76%, Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust : BUOU 0%, Paragon Reit : SK6U +0.61%, Far East Hospitality Trust : Q5T 0%, IReit Global : UD1U 0%, Sabana Industrial Reit : M1GU -1.28%, Frasers Centrepoint Trust : J69U +1.91%, Digital Core Reit : DCRU +0.98%, Frasers Hospitality Trust : ACV 0%, and Daiwa House Logistics Trust : DHLU +1.83%.

On average, these 10 have an average aggregated gearing ratio of 32.1 per cent.

According to the MAS Code on Collective Investment Schemes (latest revised Mar 9, 2023) on its website for property funds, the aggregate leverage limit is not considered to be breached if due to circumstances beyond the control of the manager such as a depreciation in the asset value of the property fund or any redemption of units or payments made from the property fund – if the aggregate leverage limit is exceeded as a result of these examples, the manager should not incur additional borrowings or enter into further deferred payment arrangements."
2023-03-20,Brokers’ take: Analysts most positive on commercial Reits amid interest-rate volatility,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/brokers-take-analysts-most-positive-commercial-reits-amid-interest-rate,"ANALYSTS remain positive on commercial real estate investment trusts (Reits) in Singapore and Malaysia. This is amid expectations that interest-rate volatility will persist in the near term, even as the Federal Reserve slows its rate hikes.

RHB on Friday downgraded Singapore-listed Reits (S-Reits) to “neutral” from “overweight” as it expects rising interest-rate volatility to continue in the near term.

From an operational standpoint, S-Reits will remain resilient, RHB said. It expects a modest cap rate expansion of between five and 25 basis points and does not foresee any large drops in asset value.


That being said, the research team projects distribution per unit growth to plateau, due to rising borrowing costs.

“Despite a reasonably well-hedged profile for S-Reits before entering into the rate upcycle in 2022, the sector was not spared from the sharp increase in interest rates impacting the unhedged portion of debt, as well as refinanced and new loans secured last year,” said RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan.

Echoing the sentiment, DBS Group Research expects S-Reits to keep facing higher financing costs as near-term base rates remain elevated at the 4 per cent level. This will continue before a gradual decline in 2024 – when the Fed is expected to stop raising interest rates and lower them in the second half of 2024.
Refinancing costs could rise between 2.5 and 3 per cent in 2023 to 2024 due to the difference in base rates, assuming a three-year refinancing profile, DBS noted.

S-Reits with higher gearing and a lower proportion of debt hedged to fixed rates will be more exposed to higher interest rates, DBS said. At present, US office and Europe-focused Reits have the highest gearing levels, which coincides with declining asset values in both markets.

Among S-Reits, RHB prefers industrial Reits and those with strong balance sheets and sponsor support. Its top picks are CapitaLand Ascendas Reit : A17U +2.65%, Aims Apac Reit : O5RU +0.78% and Keppel Reit : K71U +1.2%.

DBS also recommended that investors stay invested in logistics, retail and hospitality sectors for their earnings stability.

UOB Kay Hian (UOBKH), meanwhile, maintained its “market weight” recommendation when it comes to Malaysian Reits. It believes the sector offers a neutral level of risk-to-reward returns given current interest rate and inflation headwinds.

Malaysia Reits outperformed the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI index by 8.9 per cent and remained resilient in the year to date.

Its top pick is Axis Reit, which is the only “buy” recommendation among the Reits under its coverage. UOBKH noted that the Reit offers decent yields of at least 6 per cent from 2023, with potential upsides from future acquisitions.

On a long-term basis, UOBKH said it prefers the retail segment, particularly prime or niche malls, due to business resilience.

An uptick in international tourist arrivals will benefit the retail and hospitality segments, with better rental-reversion prospects for the retail sector. Meanwhile, industrial Reits continue to thrive.

The research team views the short to medium-term interest rates and inflation headwinds as “manageable”, given Malaysian Reits’ healthy gearing levels, which stand at 37 per cent on average – well below the threshold of 50 per cent.

Most of the debt taken on by Malaysian Reits is based on fixed financing rates, UOBKH said in a report."
2023-04-03,Shifting interest rate expectations suggest tailwinds for S-Reits,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/shifting-interest-rate-expectations-suggest-tailwinds-s-reits,"SINGAPORE-LISTED real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) are back on the radar of market watchers after a dismal showing last year. A tapering of aggressive rate hikes should support prices this year, although analysts warn it could still be a bumpy ride ahead for investors in the asset class.

The iEdge S-Reit Index has returned a total of 3 per cent in the year to Mar 23. In comparison, the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) generated total returns of -0.4 per cent over the same period.

This is a marked difference from last year, when interest rate fears triggered one of the worst sell-offs in the 20-year history of S-Reits. The S-Reits recorded total returns of -11.9 per cent in 2022, whereas the STI had total returns of 8.4 per cent.


The collapse of United States banks such as Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, as well as the troubles of Credit Suisse, have raised anticipation that the US Federal Reserve will ease off its aggressive hiking of interest rates to avoid crashing the economy.

“The recent troubles (in the banking sector) have pushed the Fed into a tough corner, with market expectations that it should turn more cautious on further rate hikes in order to alleviate the balance sheet stress seen in the banking sector due to its aggressive hike stance,” DBS analysts said in a recent report.

A pause on interest rate hikes is seen as good for Reits, which have been grappling with the high cost of debt. Even so, observers say that S-Reits are not yet out of the woods.
Maybank analyst Krishna Guha noted that US two-year and 10-year yields have fallen sharply from recent peaks following the US bank failures.

“A sustained fall in 10-year yields is positive for S-Reits as it results in a lower discount rate in our dividend discount model. Every 50-basis-point fall in the risk-free rate results in 10 per cent higher fair value for the Reits in our model,” Guha said.

But he added: “With tightening financial conditions leading to presumably wider loan spreads and elevated inflation, we maintain our ‘neutral’ sector stance.”

Expect volatility
For now, uncertainty and volatility are likely to give investors reason for pause.

Fluctuations in market sentiment over the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions have already contributed to wide swings in S-Reit prices this year.

The iEdge S-Reit Index raced up 7 per cent in January, before tumbling 3.8 per cent in February. In March, prices of S-Reits slipped another 2.1 per cent.

Gabriel Yap, chairman of investment firm GCP Global, said the price volatility is to be expected: “Like the last interest rate upcycle in 2018, we see that Reits do not go down or up in one straight line.”

The veteran Reit investor noted that S-Reits in 2018 saw price swings of 3 per cent to 15 per cent almost every month, before a recovery of the sector when interest rates stopped rising in 2019.

“We expect such punctuated rallies to persist until we finally see the terminal value or pivot of interest rates for this round,” Yap said, adding that the Fed is very “data-determined”.

Likewise, RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan said rising interest rate volatility, “which is likely to persist in the near term”, would mean S-Reits’ price performance is likely to be “range-bound”.

The brokerage has downgraded the S-Reit sector to “neutral”, from “overweight” previously.

Dark clouds and silver linings
Against this backdrop, independent financial adviser and Reits specialist Kenny Loh said investors would need to be “selective”.

“With the peaking of interest rates or potential pivoting, investors may rotate back to yield assets such as Reits and investment-grade fixed income,” said Loh. “Fundamentally, the current yield and valuation of Reits are relatively attractive. However, not all the Reits are the same.”

Loh favours the industrial sector for stable distributions and the hospitality sector for its growth prospects.

Maybank’s Guha, too, said industrial Reits should “rank favourably among investors in terms of operating metrics and their ability to recycle capital”.

The office segment is seen as less attractive.

“In general, the office and US office segments will be more sensitive to higher interest rates and further downward pressure on portfolio valuations. This is mainly due to their relatively higher gearing as compared to the other sectors,” DBS analysts said.

That could mean this sector has the most room to rebound once interest rates demonstrate a firm shift in trajectory. But analysts aren’t in favour of such risks now.

“We recommend investors stay selective and defensive, rooted on valuations,” said RHB’s Natarajan. “Our preference remains the industrial sector and Reits with strong balance sheets and sponsor support.”

GCP Global’s Yap also said investors should look at a Reit’s sponsor, adding: “Reits are only as good as the sponsors they have.”

He noted that the S-Reits backed by the MACKF sponsors – Mapletree, Ascendas, CapitaLand, Keppel and Frasers – have been among the best picks over the past two decades."
2023-04-03,"Collapsing banks, Reits hint at trouble ahead",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/collapsing-banks-reits-hint-trouble-ahead,"AN old fund manager friend told me in October last year that it was probably time to load up on stocks.

The US Federal Reserve was hiking rates at a torrid pace of 75 basis points each time. Yields on 10-year US Treasury bonds had pushed above 4 per cent. And, the S&P 500 Index had closed as low as 3,577.03 on Oct 12, 2022.

My inner bear demurred. It seemed unlikely to me that inflation could be quelled without a deep slump in economic activity and corporate profitability, which was not yet apparent. Also, I feared pockets of excesses built up during the long period of ultra-low interest rates might unwind in a disorderly manner amid the rapid tightening of monetary policy.
The series of bank failures in the United States over the past month, as well as the collapse of Credit Suisse, left me feeling somewhat vindicated. But the market seems to have taken all the bad news in its stride. With hindsight, my fund manager friend might have had the right instincts.

Since the end of October, the S&P 500 has delivered a total return of 6.9 per cent. The Nasdaq 100 recorded an even more impressive return of 16.1 per cent. And, the prospect of higher interest rates did not seem to be a factor in the performance of many stocks that helped pull these US market indices higher.

For instance, the best performing component of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 during the period was Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook). It returned 127.5 per cent as its management abruptly refocused on improving operational efficiency and profitability.
Another strong performer in both these indices was chipmaker Nvidia, which has returned 105.9 per cent since the end of October amid optimism about artificial intelligence becoming a major driver of its growth.

Wynn Resorts was the third best performing component of the S&P 500. It delivered a total return of 75.1 per cent as China eased Covid-19 restrictions in Macau.

Here in Singapore, the Straits Times Index (STI) has delivered a total return of 6.5 per cent since the end of October. Leading the STI’s advance were Sembcorp Industries, Genting Singapore and DFI Retail Group – which returned 50.5 per cent, 39.1 per cent and 36.2 per cent, respectively.

Only two of the STI’s 30 component stocks are in negative territory since the end of October: City Developments (minus 3.4 per cent) and DBS (minus 2.5 per cent). Yangzijiang Shipbuilding recorded a total return of zero during the five-month period.

So, are we at the foothills of a fresh bull market? Or, is this just another bear market rally that will soon come to an end?

Stress in Reits
The way I see it, the depositor runs on the likes of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank over the past month are a sign of looming trouble for the markets. Rising interest rates are weighing down the value of even the safest assets, and gradually rendering some financial structures and business activities unviable.

The varied performance of Singapore’s real estate investment trusts (Reits) recently offers a stark display of this trend.

Since the end of October, the iEdge S-Reit Index recorded a robust total return of 9.1 per cent. Leading the advance were Frasers Logistics and Commercial Trust and Keppel DC Reit – which delivered total returns of 22 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively. In third place was CapitaLand China Trust, with a total return of 18.8 per cent.

Against this backdrop, some Reits are expanding their portfolios. For instance, Mapletree Logistics Trust (MLT) – which has returned 15.6 per cent since the end of October – said last week that it will acquire eight assets in Japan, Australia and South Korea for a total S$913.6 million.

MLT also said it will raise S$200 million through a placement of 121.3 million new units at S$1.649 apiece. MLT closed Friday (Mar 31) at S$1.71.

Yet, some components of the iEdge S-Reit Index have performed very poorly amid the rebound in the whole market. Notably, Manulife US Reit has delivered a total return of minus 36.6 per cent since October last year.

Manulife US Reit suffered an unexpectedly large downward revaluation of its property portfolio at the end of 2022, which inflated its gearing significantly. It said in December that the reduced valuation for its properties was partly due to “higher discount rates and capitalisation rates”.

Keppel Pacific Oak US Reit (Kore) and Prime US Reit – which are similarly focused on commercial properties in the US – also appear to be facing doubts about the value of their underlying assets. Kore has returned minus 26 per cent since October, while Prime US Reit has returned minus 27.3 per cent.

Then, there is Lippo Malls Indonesia Retail Trust (LMIRT). Dogged by debt refinancing concerns, LMIRT said on Mar 20 that it will not pay distributions on a S$140 million tranche of perpetual securities issued in 2016. The move will prohibit it from making any further distributions to its unitholders.

LMIRT has delivered a total return of minus 42.7 per cent since the end of October.
The big question now is how much longer it will take for the Fed and other major central banks to get inflation under control.

On Mar 22, the Fed said it would raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.75-5 per cent. But it adopted a less certain posture on the likelihood of further tightening in the months ahead – a plain acknowledgement that financial market stress is now a risk.

Nevertheless, median projections by participants of the latest Fed meeting still put the midpoint of the federal funds rate at 5.1 per cent by end-2023 and 4.3 per cent by end-2024. In December, Fed meeting participants were projecting a federal funds rate of 5.1 per cent by end-2023 and 4.1 per cent by end-2024.

While some market watchers see the prospect of rates peaking in 2023 as a reason to be optimistic about stocks, my view is that the cumulative tightening in monetary policy over the past year is only just beginning to weigh on the global economy and financial markets.

More to the point, the Fed’s projections suggest interest rates are still set to end this year above where they are now.

In the months ahead, my sense is there will be significant volatility in the market that creates more attractive buying opportunities than we saw last October. In the meantime, my biggest challenge could be keeping my FOMO – or, fear of missing out – in check."
2023-04-04,Sabana Reit gets URA nod for S$20 million enhancement works at Tuas warehouse,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/sabana-reit-gets-ura-nod-s20-million-enhancement-works-tuas-warehouse,"THE manager of Sabana Industrial Real Estate Investment Trust (Sabana Reit) on Tuesday (Apr 4) announced that it had obtained provisional permission from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) for additions and alterations to its property at 1 Tuas Avenue 4.

The development cost of this asset enhancement initiative (AEI) will be an estimated S$20 million, the manager said. The works will be internally funded.

The Reit had earlier announced that it had obtained the consent of JTC Corporation for the addition and alteration works. This paved the way for further submissions to relevant authorities, such as URA, for approvals.
Post-AEI, the property, which the Reit manager has dubbed 1TA4, will comprise a 156,000 square foot warehouse, production facility and ancillary office.

1TA4 will also incorporate solar panels that can potentially generate more than 1,000 MW hours of energy per year, the manager said.

Last week, it announced that it was partnering Keppel EaaS, a wholly owned subsidiary of Keppel Infrastructure, to install photovoltaic solar panels across four of its properties, including 1TA4.

The 1TA4 project aims to obtain its temporary occupation permit by the first half of 2024.

The Reit manager said it is currently in talks with prospective tenants, including companies in the logistics and manufacturing trade sectors.

“Demand for warehouses continues to be a bright spot, based on our leasing enquiries and the positive response that we are seeing,” said Donald Han, chief executive officer of Sabana Reit’s manager.

“Going the route of additions and alterations will enable us to achieve a relatively shorter project timeline and, at the same time, maximise the use of the existing building structure,” he added.

Units of Sabana Reit : M1GU -1.28% closed 1.2 per cent or S$0.005 higher at S$0.44 on Tuesday, before the announcement."
2023-04-03,The woes of Credit Suisse and Cyxtera may portend trouble for landlords,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/woes-credit-suisse-and-cyxtera-may-portend-trouble-landlords,"OWN a building and collect recurrent income from legally binding agreements. Sounds easy.

However, things have been rocky for landlords in recent times. Lockdowns and movement restrictions to fight the Covid pandemic have brought into question the relevance of properties such as office buildings, and resulted in landlords extending help to tenants across various property types.

In 2022, inflation started flaring and the US Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates aggressively. Many landlords are hurt by rising costs eroding operating margins. Many property owners are also facing higher borrowing costs and credit tightening.
Might recent news of woes at the likes of Credit Suisse Group and Cyxtera Technologies signal greater turbulence ahead for landlords?

Investors may need to worry more over the creditworthiness of various tenants of property groups.

Credit Suisse
Rocked by various scandals and loss of confidence among customers, banking giant Credit Suisse teetered. To ensure financial stability, Swiss authorities engineered a deal in March for UBS Group to buy Credit Suisse – supported by billions in state funding.    
There is significant overlap in the operations of the two banks. Press reports said the enlarged UBS is set to reduce its workforce by up to 30 per cent.
As staff in the financial services sector fret, so should office landlords in major cities, including Singapore. Will anchor tenant Credit Suisse give up space at Grade A office building One Raffles Link in the Marina Bay area, which is owned by Hongkong Land : H78 +0.29%?

Given that Singapore is a major financial centre, weakness in the financial sector could hit jobs and office landlords here hard. 

CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U +2.26% (CICT) owns a diversified portfolio that includes several office buildings in the central area. Last year, financial services was the top sector for new leases signed at CICT’s Singapore office properties, accounting for about 36 per cent by net lettable area.

While office landlords worry over whether more tenants in key sectors such as financial services and technology may give up space, jitters over the financial health of tenants are being felt in other property segments too.

Cyxtera Technologies
The initial public offering (IPO) in December 2021 of pure-play data centre real estate investment trust (Reit) Digital Core Reit : DCRU +0.98% was about 19.4 times subscribed.

On its trading debut, Digital Core Reit closed almost 15 per cent above its IPO price. Today, the Reit, which owns data centres in the US, Canada and Germany, trades way below its IPO price.

Demand drivers for data centres look strong amid digital transformation across many businesses. And vacancy rates are generally low in the markets where Digital Core Reit’s data centres are located. 

But investors are nervous over the financial health of what is understood to be Digital Core Reit’s second-largest tenant – Nasdaq-listed Cyxtera Technologies. Concerns surfaced over the global colocation data centre operator’s ability to service its debt obligations.

Cyxtera accounts for about 22.6 per cent of Digital Core Reit’s annualised rental income. In-mid February, Moody’s Investor Service downgraded Cyxtera’s corporate family rating.
Digital Core Reit’s manager said on Mar 20 that its second-largest customer remains current on its rental obligations and has not requested any rent deferments, rental reductions or contraction of the space it occupies.

Still, might Cyxtera face problems meeting its rental obligations? For 2022, Cyxtera reported a loss of US$355 million.
The results announcement shows that the company has US$96 million of short-term debt which expires this year, and US$853 million in long-term debt that matures in 2024. As at end-March, Cyxtera’s share price fell over 90 per cent from a year ago.

In H1 2022, Digital Core Reit was hit by a customer bankruptcy. The Reit’s manager said in its latest annual report that it is cautiously optimistic on backfilling the affected capacity with no impact to distribution per unit.

Reasons cited are favourable data centre fundamentals, the strength of the sponsor’s global platform and cash flow support by the sponsor. 
Digital Core Reit’s unit price as at end-March is down by about 27 per cent from end-February and around 60 per cent from a year ago.
Nonetheless, investors should not get too fretful over big tenants not meeting rental obligations because of business problems.

Landlords enjoy some protection from the risk posed by troubled tenants. For example, landlords typically hold deposits that are paid upfront upon the signing of a lease. 

Should a tenant go belly up and stop paying rent, the rental deposit can perhaps help a landlord tide over for a few months while searching for a replacement tenant.

If a failing business gets rescued, the new owner generally takes over the existing lease obligations. Maybe the new owner will seek to give up some space that has been leased, but this will likely be subject to negotiations with the landlord.

In a tough economic environment, more questions can arise over the creditworthiness of various businesses.

Many landlords will be anxiously hoping that their tenants do not hit news headlines because of financial woes. 

Likely, the larger landlords with reduced single-tenant concentration can cope with headwinds. Market leader CICT has a diversified trade mix from a total of about 3,080 tenants in its portfolio. 

CICT’s latest annual report showed that no single tenant contributed above 5 per cent of gross rental income. Collectively, the top 10 tenants accounted for 19.8 per cent of total gross rent.

With worsening economic and credit conditions, landlords should prepare to deal with more tenants that may give up space or be tardy in rental payments. Ultimately, what matters is whether space that is given up can be filled up quickly and at good rates. 

Some landlords may see a silver lining, should space that is vacated be filled up at a higher rental rate. A mall owner may be glad to see an underperforming anchor tenant – who pays relatively low rent – terminate its lease early, so the occupied space can be reconfigured for more productive use.

In what will be a tougher leasing environment, landlords need to have strong products as well as asset management and leasing teams to survive."
2023-04-11,Brokers’ take: OCBC lowers ESR-Logos Reit’s fair-value estimate on enlarged share base,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/brokers-take-ocbc-lowers-esr-logos-reits-fair-value-estimate-enlarged-share-base,"OCBC Investment Research has lowered its fair-value estimate on ESR-Logos real estate investment trust : J91U 0% (Reit) from S$0.42 to S$0.38, following the Reit’s enlarged share base following its equity fundraising exercise. The research team kept its “buy” call on the Reit unchanged in a note on Tuesday (Apr 11).

Analyst Chu Peng noted that the Reit completion of its private placement at an issue price of S$0.33 per unit, and that it had at the same time also announced a non-renounceable preferential offering at an issue price of S$0.325.

These form part of the Reit’s plans to raise S$300 million, which will be used to repay debt, finance redevelopments or asset-enhancement initiatives and further acquisitions.
Chu thus lowered her FY23-FY27 distribution per unit (DPU) forecasts by 8 to 10 per cent in view of the enlarged share base.

OCBC’s research team expects the Reit’s gearing to fall to 38 per cent from 41.8 per cent. “[The Reit] is exercising prudent capital management, in our view, to lower its gearing level below 40 per cent amid a higher interest environment,” she said.

While she believes that the Reit’s fundamentals are healthy, she advised investors to consider taking up the preferential offering to avoid dilution of shares.
The research team remains cognisant of the Reit’s potential downside risks of tenant defaults or asset conversions from master-leased to multi-tenanted.
As at 4.57 pm on Tuesday, ESR-Logos Reit’s units traded 1.5 per cent or S$0.005 lower at S$0.325."
2023-04-13,Asset enhancements could bring some warmth to S-Reits amid acquisition winter,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/asset-enhancements-could-bring-some-warmth-s-reits-amid,"RISING interest rates have all but frozen the acquisition of properties by Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) – choking off a key source of net property income (NPI) and distribution per unit (DPU) growth.
Analysts said there are still some opportunities for accretive acquisitions in the market. Under the current cloud of uncertainty, however, they expect Reit managers to switch tack and focus on asset enhancements instead.
There have been four proposed property acquisitions in the first quarter of 2023. Three of them happened in the same month.
In January, ARA US Hospitality Trust : XZL 0% proposed to acquire a 119-room Hilton-branded hotel property in the US for US$29 million; CapitaLand India Trust : CY6U 0% entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire a one million square foot (sq ft) IT park in Bangalore for 12.3 billion rupees (S$201 million); and Frasers Centrepoint Trust : J69U +1.91% – together with sponsor Frasers Property : TQ5 -1.22% – announced the joint acquisition of a 50 per cent stake in suburban mall Nex for S$652.5 million.

After a steep drop in the number of transactions last year – S-Reits announced 30 asset acquisitions in 2022, whereas there were over 50 in 2021 – the spate of acquisitions in January raised hopes that the worst could be over.

But renewed fears of interest rate hikes in February brought a chill to the dealmaking scene.
The dry spell was broken only last month, when Mapletree Logistics Trust : M44U +1.94% at the end of March announced the acquisition of eight logistics properties in Japan, Australia and South Korea for a total of S$913.6 million.

In comparison, there were seven acquisitions announced in the corresponding quarter the year before.

Market watchers said deal flow for property acquisitions is likely to remain slow in the months ahead.

Discussions are hampered by continued uncertainty over interest rates. And concerns have also mounted following the banking crisis in the United States and Europe.

“The current slowdown in S-Reit acquisitions is a function of market conditions, especially high interest rates that have made accretive and attractive acquisitions much less likely,” said RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan.

“Overall, we believe acquisitions will likely take a backseat this year, with total S-Reit acquisitions likely to be below S$3 billion – a moderation from S$5 billion last year,” he added. “For acquisition markets to return, we believe interest rates need to peak and turn – along with a moderation in sellers’ pricing expectations.”

DBS analyst Derek Tan shared similar sentiments. “The cost of debt remains prohibitive for S-Reits to make accretive acquisitions as asset values have yet to really correct to reflect the new interest rate environment,” he said.

Tan nevertheless believes selected S-Reit sectors, such as hotels and industrials, can still pull off accretive acquisitions.

“We may see selective buying and, potentially, some equity raising, as most managers are unlikely to want to leverage up post-deal,” he said. “We need clarity on the Federal Reserve front, so Q2 after May 2023 will be the time to watch.”

A lack of deals need not be a bad thing for Reit investors, though.

Gabriel Yap, a veteran Reit investor and chairman of investment firm GCP Global, noted that “most Reits’ acquisitions have not been really DPU-accretive in the past few years”.

Yap said asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs) tabled by some S-Reits have brought better returns for investors. For example, he said, several industrial S-Reits have guided NPI yields of between 6 per cent and 8 per cent on significant AEI projects planned for 2023 and 2024.

“On a comparative basis, it’s a better usage of capital funds than making new acquisitions on thin NPI and DPU accretions in an environment of higher risk and higher interest rates,” he explained.

While turning away from acquisitions will result in a slowdown in assets under management growth and inorganic DPU growth, RHB’s Natarajan said S-Reits should remain cautious and extremely selective on acquisitions in current market conditions.

“We believe (engaging in AEIs) is the right strategy for the Reits to employ in market downturns and in the current environment where cost of capital has sharply moved up,” Natarajan said.

DBS’ Tan noted, however, that it is tougher for AEIs to move the needle on NPI and DPU, as AEIs tend to be relatively small compared with acquisitions or developments.

Added Tan: “AEI is also tough to execute, mainly because construction costs have risen substantially, compressing returns. Also, due to labour shortages, the timeline to complete (AEI works) is also longer.”"
2023-04-16,AUM in Reit ETFs via digital platforms up 7 times in 3 years,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/aum-reit-etfs-digital-platforms-7-times-3-years,"AS SINGAPORE’S Reit ecosystem matures, the shelf of Reit exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed on the SGX has also grown from three ETFs with combined assets under management (AUM) of S$357 million just three years ago to five ETFs with combined AUM of S$867 million as at Mar 31, 2023.
The five Reit ETFs (in order of AUM size) are NikkoAM-StraitsTrading Asia ex Japan Reit ETF, Lion-Phillip  S-Reit ETF, CSOP iEdge SReit Leaders Index ETF, UOB APAC Green Reit ETF and Phillip SGX APAC DIV  Reit ETF. 
While total AUM doubled over the three-year period, the proportion of AUM holdings by institutional  investors was overtaken by retail investors. Retail investors currently account for 41 per cent of the  AUM in the five Reit ETFs while institutional investors make up another 40 per cent. In March 2020, institutional investors held 56 per cent and retail investors 35 per cent.  
With the rise of digital investment platforms, the proportion of AUM holdings in robo-advisory portfolios  and regular savings plans tripled from 4 per cent back in March 2020 to 13 per cent as at March 2023. This  translates to over seven times growth in value, from S$16 million to S$114 million across the period.  The proportion of AUM holdings via the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) and the CPF Investment  Scheme (CPF-IS) has also grown from 4 per cent to 6 per cent across the same period. 
In terms of sector performance, the local iEdge S-Reit Index, which gained 4.3 per cent in total returns in  Q1 2023, outran the global FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index, which ended the quarter flat. Similarly,  the two Reit ETFs with 100 per cent exposure to the S-Reits sector (Lion-Phillip S-Reit ETF and CSOP  iEdge SReit Leaders Index ETF) averaged 5.1 per cent total returns over the period, outperforming the other three ETFs which saw 1 per cent average declines.  
The Lion-Phillip S-Reit ETF tracks the Morningstar® Singapore Reit Yield Focus Index SM and was the  best performer in Q1 2023 with 5.4 per cent total returns and a dividend yield of 5.2 per cent. This was  followed by the CSOP iEdge SReit Leaders Index ETF, which tracks the iEdge SReit Leaders Index, with  4.5 per cent total returns in Q1 2023 and a dividend yield of 4.9 per centThe NikkoAM-StraitsTrading Asia ex Japan Reit ETF, which has exposure to Asia ex-Japan Reits, saw total  returns of 1.4 per cent and boasts the highest dividend yield among the five at 5.5 per cent. On the  other hand, the Phillip SGX APAC DIV Reit ETF and UOB APAC Green Reit ETF saw respective declines of  0.9 per cent and 3.6 per cent. "
2023-04-17,All eyes on how S-Reits navigate rate hikes as earnings season looms,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/all-eyes-how-s-reits-navigate-rate-hikes-earnings-season-looms,"THE units of real estate investment trusts (Reits) listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) have fared relatively well in the first quarter of the year despite concerns over the impact of persistently sticky inflation and the banking turmoil in the US and Europe.

The iEdge S-Reit Index rose 2 per cent in the first quarter of 2023, snapping a four-quarter-long losing streak. It outperformed the Straits Times Index, which gained just 0.2 per cent over the same period.

The outperformance from Reits came amid greater investor hopes that increasing macroeconomic headwinds and signs of financial instability in US banks could signal an imminent pause to the US Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes.


But even as investors grow slightly more optimistic, analysts are keeping a close watch in the upcoming earnings season on Reits’ operational metrics – such as occupancy and rent reversion – and how their financials are holding up in the current higher interest rate environment.

“In general, we are expecting the S-Reits to deliver quarter-on-quarter improvement in net property income (NPI) given that the real estate cycle still remains in the landlords’ favour,” said Derek Tan, analyst at DBS Group Research.

He added that the research house is watching the overall financial metrics such as interest coverage ratios and gearing to ensure they are in line with growth estimates for the sector.
“While NPI is growing, (interest rate) increase is estimated to outpace a lot of the good work done by the managers,” Tan said.

Meanwhile, Maybank analyst Krishna Guha also noted that the house would be monitoring commentary around lending spreads and watching if there have been any changes to funding cost guidance since the last quarter.

Other things to watch closely, according to Guha, are how capitalisation rates are trending as well as rental reversions for industrials, office and retail Reits, and forward booking for hotels.

“We will look (for) improved operating metrics and guidance for commercial Reits with downtown malls and hospitality Reits,” he said. “On Singapore offices, we will look for guidance on leasing trends given that spot rent growth has slowed down.”

DBS’ Tan expects operational metrics to remain fairly stable for now. “We favour the retail and industrial sub-sectors with hotels expected to still deliver year-on-year improvement in RevPAR (revenue per available room),” he said.

Analysts also noted that portfolio valuations are another area they would be monitoring to ensure that the property net asset values are resilient and supported in the current environment.

RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan noted that overseas S-Reits, especially those with portfolios in the US and Europe, are currently the ones “under significant stress” amid sharp interest rate increases, economic slowdown and a pullback in bank financing.

“We will be monitoring this sector closely for financial stress,” Natarajan said.

The earnings season for S-Reits will start with first quarter business updates from Keppel Pacific Oak US Reit and Keppel DC Reit on Tuesday (Apr 18).

S-Reits that are scheduled to release their results for the full year ending March include Aims Apac Reit and the trio of Mapletree Reits. Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust and Mapletree Industrial Trust will release their results on Apr 27.

Maybank’s Guha said he will be looking out for the impact of Singapore’s manufacturing sector slowdown on the operating metrics of Mapletree Industrial Trust, as well as further guidance on US data centre leases.

For Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust, Guha noted that areas of focus would include operating trends for VivoCity and Festival Walk, as well as the impact from reopening.

The trio of Frasers Reits are also set to release their earnings report card for the first-half period ending March. Frasers Centrepoint Trust (FCT) will release its results on Apr 26, followed by Frasers Hospitality Trust on Apr 28 while Frasers Logistics and Commercial Trust will do so on May 4.

The performance of FCT is one that analysts are keeping a close eye on.

DBS’ Tan said: “We are keenly looking at FCT for its operational stats to see how consumer sentiment is affected by the high inflation rate.”

RHB’s Natarajan added: “FCT remains one of our preferred retail sector picks for its resilient and defensive suburban mall portfolio exposure, which has generally performed well in market downturns. The only concern here has been on the balance sheet and interest cost side with close to half of its debts due for refinancing this year and next.”"
2023-04-18,S-Reits losing appeal: Average yield of 6% is not good enough,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/s-reits-losing-appeal-average-yield-6-not-good-enough,"AFTER one of the biggest sell-offs in history, Singapore real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) were rather resilient year to date, largely thanks to the banking crisis which fuelled a dramatic repricing of interest-rate expectations.

However, this may not be the time for investors to rejoice, as the current macroeconomic environment remains challenging for S-Reits. For one thing, higher operating expenses and borrowing costs have been commonly cited by S-Reits as headwinds to their distributions.

Impact of higher rates and slowing growth underestimated
While the pace of interest-rate hikes may become more measured, rate cuts are unlikely this year even if a recession ensues, as inflation is likely to take much longer than expected to moderate. Consequently, interest rates are likely to remain higher for longer.
Hence, although the majority of Reits’ existing debt is on fixed rates, Reits will eventually be forced to refinance their expiring loans at higher rates, resulting in a higher average cost of debt.

Moreover, capitalisation rates are likely to expand as interest rates remain elevated – there is little reason to think they would decline meaningfully – and as growth prospects are dampened. Therefore, property valuations have scope to fall. At a price-to-book ratio of 0.95X, it is implied that S-Reits are trading at just a 5 per cent discount to their current book value, providing little margin of safety.

Meanwhile, the slowdown in commercial leasing activity is likely to put downward pressure on rental rates, and consequently there is potential for distribution per unit (DPU) deterioration. Consensus estimates indicate that DPU growth among Reits will be modest in FY2023.
Excluding the hospitality sub-sector, aggregate growth remains positive. Conversely, in the last two global recessions, S-Reits recorded double-digit negative growth. Thus S-Reits are vulnerable to negative price reaction from earnings disappointment as the macro backdrop weakens.

Refinancing worries
Besides, the banking crisis has raised fresh concerns regarding the reverberations of higher interest rates. Even before the Silicon Valley Bank saga, Brookfield Corp and Columbia Property Trust defaulted on loans tied to their office buildings in gateway cities such as Los Angeles and New York, as they battle higher financing costs and elevated office vacancy rates.

Tighter financial conditions suggest that Reits with high leverage may find it increasingly difficult to meet their debt obligations or roll over existing debt maturities. The spillover impact from financial stresses is well documented in the US office Reit segment. Share prices of the trio of SGX-listed US office Reits – Manulife US Reit, Prime US Reit, and Keppel Pacific Oak US Reit – slumped as the market reassessed their financial stability and tenant risk.

In the case of Manulife US Reit, its leverage catapulted from 42.8 per cent to 48.8 per cent, which is a hair’s breadth below the regulatory limit of 50 per cent, on lower property valuations. With US$143 million worth of revolving credit facility and other loans due in 2024, higher leverage raises concerns over its refinancing capabilities. Downside risks include dilution from equity fundraising or the sale of properties. Of late, it has already announced and completed the divestment of its Tanasbourne property.

Don’t be satisfied with 6% yield for S-Reits
Overall, in view of optimistic estimates and an uncertain macro backdrop, we are still not convinced that the S-Reit sector as a whole presents an attractive risk-reward proposition. The rapid rise in bond yields has provided investors with the opportunity to earn higher yields without taking on the risk associated with equities.

Also, the yield spread between the S-Reit sector and the Singapore 10-year government bond remains at a multi-year low, implying that investors are compensated with a lower risk premium.
In our view, investors should be expecting a yield of over 7 per cent from S-Reits overall, based on the historical yield spread and the 10-year government bond yield. Today, S-Reits offer a forward distribution yield of only 6 per cent. The downside is that share prices could correct by at least 10 per cent.

At an asset class level, we are underweight on equities (including Reits) relative to fixed income. With the growing attractiveness of fixed income, investors may consider bond funds. For investors who wish to retain exposure to S-Reits, balance sheet strength ought to be a key differentiator. Amidst tighter financial conditions, it would be prudent to avoid Reits with high gearing ratios of over 40 per cent.
Security selection can also be made on a sectoral level. For example, logistics properties should see sustained demand from secular trends like supply chain diversification, providing Reits with resilience in this sector. Meanwhile, US office Reits are trading at depressed valuations, and investors should enter at their own risk. Manulife US Reit faces several hurdles, including the uncertainty over the Reit manager’s possible acquisition by Mirae Asset Global Investments.

Lastly, it remains unclear if China’s post-pandemic surge in spending will be sustainable against the global macro backdrop, which should have an impact on retail and hospitality S-Reits.

2023-04-19,Keppel Reit Q1 distributable income from operations down 6.7% on higher borrowing costs,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/keppel-reit-q1-distributable-income-operations-down-67-higher-borrowing-costs,"KEPPEL Reit : K71U +1.2% posted a distributable income from operations of S$50.2 million for its first quarter ended Mar 31, 2023, down 6.7 per cent from S$53.8 million in the same period a year earlier.

This was mainly due to higher borrowing costs, the Reit’s manager said in a business update on Wednesday (Apr 19).

However, the Reit will also be distributing an anniversary distribution of S$5 million for the quarter, in celebration of its 20th anniversary in 2026. The manager earlier announced that the Reit would distribute a total of S$100 million of the anniversary distribution over a five-year period.


This brings the Reit’s total distributable income for the quarter to S$55.2 million, up 2.6 per cent from the year-ago period.

Property income was up 5.9 per cent to S$57.7 million for the quarter, from S$54.5 million the year before.

Net property income (NPI) attributable to unitholders grew 1.3 per cent on year to S$40.5 million, from S$40 million a year earlier.

The Reit recorded higher NPI for the majority of its properties in the quarter, due to higher rentals achieved on leases committed in 2022 as well as a higher portfolio occupancy, its manager said.

Keppel Reit’s portfolio committed occupancy stood at 96.3 per cent, and its portfolio weighted average lease expiry stood at 5.8 years as at Mar 31.

Its aggregate leverage was 38.7 per cent, with no major refinancing requirements in 2023.

2023-04-24,Hospitality S-Reits still have room to grow as Chinese travellers return,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/hospitality-s-reits-still-have-room-grow-chinese-travellers-return,"HOSPITALITY real estate investment trusts (Reits) rebounded strongly in 2022, with their distributions per unit (DPU) improving more than their peers as global travel restrictions eased.

While most of these counters are still trading below their pre-pandemic levels, analysts who spoke to The Business Times believe the return of Chinese travellers may help provide the boost needed for further growth.

For the full year ended December 2022, Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) in the hospitality sector saw the strongest DPU improvement among the S-Reit cohort, with the median DPU rising 31.6 per cent.


The higher DPU came amid improvements in operating performance as borders reopened and travel resumed. Revenue per available room (RevPar) in 2022 still lagged 2019 levels for the full year, but stronger performance started to come through in the fourth quarter.

For example, the RevPar of Far East Hospitality Trust’s : Q5T 0% (FEHT) hotels segment steadily improved from S$59 in Q1 2022 to S$128 in Q4 2022 – this was around 90 per cent of RevPar for the same period in 2019.

FEHT’s serviced residences segment also saw revenue per available unit (RevPau) rise to S$209 in Q4 2022, which was around 15 per cent higher than 2019 levels.
Meanwhile, CapitaLand Ascott Trust : HMN +1.13% had RevPau of S$120 in 2022, around 79 per cent of 2019’s levels. Its performance has been improving, with RevPau in Q4 2022 reaching S$155, in line with Q4 2019 pre-pandemic levels.

CDL Hospitality Trusts : J85 -0.99% also reported that 13 out of its 17 hotels had achieved RevPar exceeding pre-pandemic levels by Q4 2022.

DBS analysts Geraldine Wong, Tabitha Foo and Derek Tan said in a note this month that 2022 results for the hospitality S-Reits “were inspiring, despite China not being back in the travel game”.

“Most of our hospitality S-Reits have seen portfolio RevPar recover to at least 90 per cent of pre-pandemic levels in Q4 2022, with leisure-focused hospitality S-Reits, such as CDL Hospitality Trusts, benefitting from the generosity of leisure travellers,” the analysts said.

Chinese travellers would be the “long-awaited last piece of the travel puzzle”, they added, noting that such travellers account for around 30 per cent to 35 per cent of Asia’s inbound market share.

“Forward leading indicators show that Chinese travel demand recovery will be fast, wide, and furious, albeit from a low recovery base,” they said.

“S-Reit hoteliers are well positioned to welcome the first flock of Chinese travellers post-reopening, as they have a combined 77 per cent exposure within the top 10 destination markets for Chinese travellers, kicking off the next leg of growth.”

Similarly, Maybank analyst Krishna Guha is positive on the sector, due to the expected rebound in visitor arrivals from China.

He noted that Chinese travellers had accounted for around 20 per cent of international travellers before the pandemic, and probably a larger percentage of tourism spending.

“Once there is visibility of demand normalisation, we expect investors to be constructive and re-rate the sub-sector,” he said.

Guha expects RevPar to climb back to pre-pandemic levels by 2025 as international visitor arrivals recover. Maybank has “buy” ratings on CapitaLand Ascott Trust, CDL Hospitality Trusts, FEHT and Frasers Hospitality Trust : ACV +1%.

DBS also has “buy” ratings on all five hospitality S-Reits. Its picks within the sector are CapitaLand Ascott Trust and CDL Hospitality Trusts “to ride on global recovery and sustenance of high RevPar”.

The research house predicts that hospitality S-Reits will continue to see growth in the double-digit range on a year-on-year basis, which would “more than compensate for the higher interest-rate expenses this year and in 2024”.

The DBS analysts also noted that most of the hospitality S-Reits are currently trading below book value, with price-to-book ratios of around 0.7 to 0.9.

“We anticipate that stronger cash flows in 2023 will continue to support capital values for 2023, while the sector could re-rate to trade above its historical mean of 0.9 times, and closer to its book values,” they added.

Not everyone is optimistic about the sector, though.

RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan said hospitality sector Reit valuations are “not cheap” with the sector already trading close to its five-year average price-to-book ratio of 0.9 times.

“This indicates that optimism from a post-pandemic surge has been priced in. With increasing inflationary pressures and recessionary risks, we believe there is a possibility of some of the hospitality demand slowing down post the initial surge from the lockdown,” he said.

While there has been optimism over the return of Chinese visitors, Natarajan noted the pick-up has been slower than anticipated.

“We expect hospitality stocks to trade more range-bound in the near term, with risks tilted towards the downside,” he added.

“Business travel post-Covid has been slow to recover unlike leisure travel which has seen a sharp pent-up demand. So we believe stabilising and brightening of economic outlook along with stronger return of business travel are the likely key catalysts for the sector.”"
2023-04-24,"Dasin Retail Trust’s portfolio valuation falls; sponsor grapples with litigation, equity issues",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/dasin-retail-trusts-portfolio-valuation-falls-sponsor-grapples-litigation-equity,"PRELIMINARY independent valuations have pointed to an overall decline in the value of Dasin Retail Trust : CEDU -1.75%’s portfolio as at end-December 2022.

On Monday (Apr 24) the China-focused real estate investment trust’s (Reit) trustee-manager said its portfolio valuation fell 14 per cent in renminbi terms when compared to the seven properties’ aggregate value as at end-June, 2022. This translates to a steeper 23 per cent decline in Singapore-dollar terms.

The fall in valuation was attributed to factors such as a general decline in market performance and rental rates, lower passing rent, and a lower projected growth rate in rent.
There were also negative reversion rental rates from some leases contracted in 2022 along with higher vacancy rates, noted the trustee-manager.

Due to the lower valuation of its properties and the weakening of the renminbi against the Singapore dollar, US dollar and Hong Kong dollar – in which the trust’s offshore loans are denominated – Dasin Retail Trust also faces a breach of its gearing, loan-to-valuation and interest coverage ratio obligations under its offshore facilities.

The trustee-manager said it intends to seek a waiver from lenders of any breach of financial covenants, as part of ongoing discussions with its lenders to restructure and reschedule the group’s debt obligations.
Recent checks have also revealed several litigation and equity matters faced by the trust’s sponsor.

In a separate update on Monday, the trustee-manager said its litigation searches on the trust’s sponsor, Zhongshan Dasin Real Estate, since 2020 revealed there were at least a total of 113 cases involving the sponsor.

The sponsor was a plaintiff in another 12 cases, the defendant in 94 cases, and “was involved in some other capacity” in seven cases.

Most of the disputes appeared to mainly involve contract disputes over commercial housing reservation, construction projects, labour remuneration, sales, financial loans, decoration, advertising, and services. 

The amounts claimed were only traced for 49 cases in which the sponsor was a defendant, with claims totalling some 1.8 billion yuan (S$344.2 million).

Among other revelations, the trustee-manager has also flagged at least nine existing freeze orders against Zhongshan Dasin Real Estate’s equity interests in some of its subsidiaries. These were mainly on the basis of loan disputes and construction project contract disputes, it said.

Another seven cases of equity freezes have since been lifted.

Referring to the litigation and equity freeze searches, the trustee-manager emphasised that information on confidential cases, and cases still in progress, are unavailable to the public.

It is also likely that China’s Supreme People’s Court’s database may not be fully updated due to a time lag between local courts and their submission of judgements.

Dasin Retail Trust’s trustee-manager said the sponsor is not subject to any winding-up proceedings at present.

Its board is also of the view that these matters have not materially affected the trust’s day-to-day operations thus far. However, it is “difficult to say for certain” if these matters could create negative perceptions of the trust, which could have an adverse effect on the trust’s financial condition and operations.

“It is possible that the freezing orders and other enforcement action against the sponsor in China may be interpreted to mean that the sponsor, and by the trust’s close association with the sponsor, the trust as well, are facing financial challenges, whether real or perceived, and may also possibly have impacted how the lenders deal with the trust and its refinancing efforts. However, there is no clear evidence of this at this juncture,” said the trustee-manager.

Units of Dasin Retail Trust were trading S$0.002 or 1.4 per cent lower at S$0.142 as at 1.42pm on Monday, after both announcements were made."
2023-04-25,"First Reit’s Q1 DPU down 6.1% on higher financing costs, forex losses",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/first-reits-q1-dpu-down-61-higher-financing-costs-forex-losses,"FIRST Real Estate Investment Trust (First Reit)’s distribution per unit (DPU) for the first quarter ended March has fallen 6.1 per cent on year to 0.62 Singapore cent from 0.66 cent in Q1 2022.

On Tuesday (Apr 25), the healthcare-focused trust’s manager said this was largely due to higher financing costs and the depreciation of foreign currencies against the Singapore dollar.

Rental and other income for Q1 was up 4.9 per cent to S$26.8 million, from S$25.5 million the previous year. Net property and other income rose 2.7 per cent year on year to S$25.8 million from S$25.2 million. 


The topline growth came on the back of full-quarter contributions from First Reit’s nursing homes in Japan acquired over 2022.

Higher rental income from First Reit’s Indonesia and Singapore properties also boosted overall income contributions for the quarter. 

This was however offset by the absence of rental income from Siloam Hospitals Surabaya, which was divested in September 2022, along with the depreciation of foreign currencies against the Singapore dollar. 

The distributable amount for Q1 was S$12.7 million, up 8.3 per cent from S$11.7 million in Q1 2022.

The Reit’s unit base was 0.8 per cent higher than in Q1 2022 after issuing 421.1 million new units to partially fund its acquisition of 12 nursing homes in Japan.

It has fixed or hedged 62.8 per cent of its debt as at Mar 31, 2023.

The manager said it believes the Reit is “well-positioned to ride the tailwinds in the healthcare sector to deliver sustainable distributions” going forward.

Units of First Reit : AW9U -2.13% ended Monday flat at S$0.255.

2023-04-26,Frasers Centrepoint Trust manager bullish on leasing demand even as H1 DPU slips 0.1% to S$0.0613,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/frasers-centrepoint-trust-manager-bullish-leasing-demand-even-h1-dpu-slips-01,"The retail real estate investment trust’s (Reit) gross revenue and net property income (NPI) improved. However, property expenses were higher year on year, financial results released on Wednesday (Apr 26) showed.

Committed occupancy for the Reit’s retail portfolio hit a high of 99.2 per cent in the first half. Century Square’s occupancy grew to 96.8 per cent from 88.7 per cent, after the manager secured lease commitment for the property’s anchor cinema space. 

“The headline occupancy is really a testament that we have very strong demand,” said Richard Ng, CEO of FCT’s manager, at a media briefing accompanying the results announcement. “Prime retail space is one where retailers are very focused on over the course of the pandemic, and also partly because of the increase in costs, there is a flight towards quality.”

The real estate investment trust (Reit) manager noted that its asset enhancement initiative (AEI) at Tampines 1, scheduled to complete in the third quarter of 2024, is also showing strong leasing traction.

“The 90 per cent pre-commitment to our AEI at Tampines 1 (achieved prior the works commencement), again, is a testament that we have very strong demand,” Ng said.
For the six months ended Mar 31, gross revenue was up 6.5 per cent to S$187.6 million from S$176.2 million in the year-ago period on the back of higher occupancy, stronger turnover rents, and positive rental reversion for new and renewed leases. Atrium income also rose as events resumed on Mar 29, 2022.

NPI grew 5.7 per cent on year to S$138 million for the half year, from S$130.5 million.

Distributable income increased 0.3 per cent to S$104.7 million, from S$104.4 million in the same period a year ago. The manager had retained S$3 million in tax-exempt income available for distribution to unitholders, but released S$1.7 million of income available for distribution previously retained in H2 2022.

The distribution will be paid out on May 30, after books closure on May 5.
FCT’s aggregate leverage stood at 39.6 per cent as at Mar 31, 2023, up from 33 per cent on Sep 30, 2022. This was mainly due to increased bank borrowings to fund the Reit’s acquisition of a 25.5 per cent interest in Nex and additional 10 per cent interest in Waterway Point. 

Ng said that the acquisitions will provide additional growth for FCT. The manager is also looking at growth opportunities through further acquisitions and asset enhancement initiatives. 

“When we evaluate opportunities, we are always looking from the perspective of ‘how could this acquisition add onto our portfolio?’... We are not going to go in and acquire something that is going to destroy value,” Ng noted.

Meanwhile, FCT’s proportion of fixed interest rate borrowings was raised to 76.4 per cent from 73.2 per cent as at Dec 31, 2022, to better manage interest-rate risks. The all-in average cost of debt in the year to date stands at 3.6 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent as at Dec 31.  

“Despite the headwinds from rising interest rates and operating costs, we saw good traction in lease renewals and signing of new tenants amid improved retailer sentiments and healthy consumer spending,” Ng said.

He also noted an increasing trend of consumers prioritising their spending on essential goods and services, which bodes well for FCT’s retail portfolio.

FCT units were trading 1.3 per cent or S$0.03 lower at S$2.29 as at 10.15 am on Wednesday."
2023-04-28,MPACT’s Greater China lag takes shine away from strong Singapore showing,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/mpacts-greater-china-lag-takes-shine-away-strong-singapore-showing,"EVEN as China announced the scrapping of its strict zero-Covid policy towards the end of 2022, a lag in recovery for Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust’s : N2IU +1.46% (MPACT) assets in Greater China is weighing on its overall growth.

The Festival Walk mall in Hong Kong – MPACT’s biggest property by asset value – experienced rental reversion of minus 12.7 per cent for the full year ended March 2023.

Meanwhile, rental reversion at its Gateway Plaza office asset in Beijing and Sandhill Plaza business park in Shanghai came in at minus 3.7 per cent for the financial year from 2022 to 2023.
All its other properties in Singapore, Japan and South Korea recorded positive rental reversions of between 1.6 per cent and 14.2 per cent.

“If you look at Hong Kong, of course it’s slower. It used to be about four million (tourist arrivals) a month from China… (but) in the last two months it was about two million (in total). So there’s still some room (for improvement),” said Sharon Lim, chief executive of the trust’s manager, at a briefing on Friday (Apr 28).

Shopper traffic was recorded at 29.8 million in FY2022/23, up 16 per cent year on year. However, this remained significantly lower than the 41.3 million shoppers captured in FY2018/19. Even before curbs due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the mall had been shut for repairs after suffering damage by anti-government protestors in late 2019.
Tenant sales were up 9.3 per cent year on year to HK$3.9 billion (S$664.3 million) in FY2022/23, but remained 26 per cent lower than in FY2018/19.

The way Lim sees it, rental reversion is “en route” to recovery. The real estate investment trust (Reit) manager noted that the Festival Walk mall recorded rental reversions of minus 27 per cent and minus 21 per cent in FY2021/22 and FY2020/21 respectively.

But first, she says, there must be signs of a consistent recovery.

“It has to be consistent, because the tenants have suffered for three to four years. They are not going to buy in with one quarter of good sales and say: ‘Hey, I’ll give you the rent’,” Lim said. “They need to see some sustained higher sales.”

The performance at MPACT’s assets in Hong Kong and China stands in stark contrast to that of its assets in Singapore.

For example, at VivoCity – Singapore’s largest shopping mall – full-year tenant sales surpassed S$1 billion for the first time, as shopper traffic rose 48.4 per cent and tenant sales climbed 30.6 per cent. The mall recorded reversion rates of 7.7 per cent for FY2022/23.

Citi analyst Brandon Lee believes that the outlook could be brighter for Festival Walk in future.

“Festival Walk continued to witness negative reversion of minus 12.7 per cent in FY2023, but improving sales and traffic as a result of the opening of borders with China and the lifting of all remaining measures do provide optimism going into the next fiscal year,” he said.

However, he cautioned that MPACT’s China assets could continue to experience weakness in view of a significant supply expected to come online in both the Shanghai and Beijing markets.

MPACT’s gross revenue grew 65.4 per cent to S$826.2 million for FY2022/23, while net property income rose 62.6 per cent to S$631.9 million.

This was mainly due to contributions from properties acquired through the merger of Mapletree Commercial Trust and Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust to form MPACT, which was completed on Jul 21, 2022.

Full-year distribution per unit (DPU) was 0.8 per cent higher at S$0.0961. Excluding the release of retained cash in the year-ago period, DPU for FY2022/23 would have been 6.1 per cent higher."
2023-04-28,"Data centres could soon make up 75% of MIT’s portfolio, but don’t call it a data centre Reit",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/data-centres-could-soon-make-75-mits-portfolio-dont-call-it-data,"THE manager of Mapletree Industrial Trust : ME8U +1.83% (MIT) said that two-thirds of its portfolio may be made up of data centres within the next two years – with the “possibility” that this might be increased to 75 per cent further down the line.

“In terms of asset type, for the time being, our focus will still be on data centres,” said Tham Kuo Wei, chief executive officer of the manager, at a briefing on Friday (Apr 28). “That’s the reason why we will probably be comfortable with letting the ratio creep up to, say, three-quarters.”

However, he stressed that this was not a target that the real estate investment trust (Reit) manager has in mind.
“Would we want to push for 75 per cent as a target? No. We are only looking at that as a band that we might see how the portfolio will be represented,” he said. “It is not a destination.”

“(It is) for us to gauge the level of support and level of interest,” Tham added. “But, I think, at this point in time, it is safe for us to say we are not turning ourselves into a data centre real estate investment trust (Reit).”

Already, data centres account for 53.7 per cent of MIT’s S$8.8 billion in assets under management as at end-March. Its data centres in North America alone make up just over half – or 50.3 per cent – of the Reit’s entire portfolio.
The remainder of its portfolio comprises hi-tech buildings (17.3 per cent), flatted factories (16.4 per cent), business park buildings (6.2 per cent), stack-up or ramp-up buildings (5.8 per cent), and light industrial buildings (0.6 per cent).

But the Reit manager is not writing off the other types of industrial assets.

“At the same time, we are keeping an eye out on other asset or property types that fall within the industrial mandate, whether they are high-tech buildings, R&D facilities, or even biotech pharma facilities,” Tham said.

“If those opportunities were to surface and we are able to find a good match, we will certainly think of bringing them into the portfolio as well,” he said.

He added that MIT will also look to diversify beyond Singapore and North America, into developed markets in Europe and Asia. “We will continue to look at these locations. Hopefully, we are able to find the right assets to bring into the portfolio,” he said.

For the full year ended March, MIT reported a 1.7 per cent dip in distribution per unit (DPU) to S$0.1357, from S$0.138 in FY21/22.

This was largely due to an enlarged unit base with additional units issued under the distribution reinvestment plan.

The amount available for distribution to unitholders rose 1.6 per cent to S$356.6 million, from S$350.9 million the year before.

FY22/23 gross revenue was 12.3 per cent higher at S$684.9 million, while net property income grew 9.7 per cent to S$518 million.

The Reit manager attributed the growth to contribution from the acquisition of 29 data centres in the US, partially offset by higher borrowing costs.

Citi analyst Brandon Lee noted that MIT’s FY22/23 results missed consensus estimates.

“(This) illustrated the negative impact from higher debt cost, which more than offset still-decent organic growth within its Singapore portfolio,” he said.

Still, the analyst saw a silver lining in the Reit’s data centre assets.

“Interestingly, valuation of its US data centre portfolio inched up marginally despite 25 basis point cap rate expansion, which showcased the bright supply-demand and rental growth dynamics of this sector, in our view,” Lee said. He added that the marginal valuation uplift was due to higher market rents.

Units of MIT closed flat at S$2.38 on Friday."

Gross revenue for the quarter was up 14.4 per cent year on year to S$388.5 million, from S$339.7 million previously, the manager announced on Friday (Apr 28).
CICT’s Q1 2023 performance was boosted by contributions from the acquisitions of a 70 per cent interest in CapitaSky and three Australian assets, in the second half of last year, as well as higher income from existing properties. These gains were partially offset by higher operating costs and the divestment of JCube, which was completed in March 2022.
Portfolio occupancy for the quarter was 96.2 per cent, up from 93.6 per cent in 2022. Its weighted average lease expiry remained stable at 3.7 years.

CICT also secured positive rental reversions of 6 per cent for its retail portfolio and 4.2 per cent for its office portfolio in Q1 2023.

With the large-scale relaxation of Covid-19 measures since April 2022, CICT said its retail tenants saw a 10.2 per cent rise in sales and a 26.7 per cent rise in shopper traffic for Q1 2023.

The manager’s outlook for the trust’s retail portfolio in Singapore is positive, on the back of China’s reopening and the continued recovery of tourism.

2023-05-02,"MLT manager turns cautious on forex, interest rate impact",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/mlt-manager-turns-cautious-forex-interest-rate-impact,"THE manager of Mapletree Logistics Trust : M44U +1.94% (MLT) on Tuesday (May 2) warned of more uncertainty ahead, as higher interest rate costs and foreign exchange fluctuations continue to impact its performance.

“No matter how resilient and robust we make our portfolio, the headwinds of what is happening globally against the Singapore dollar, as well as the interest rates, that is going to continue to impact us,” said Ng Kiat, chief executive officer of the manager, at a briefing following the release of its results for the full year ended March.

“I want to highlight this word of caution that, moving ahead, we will continue to see a very resilient portfolio, we will continue to have positive rental reversions… but the forex and the interest costs are going to hit us quite badly,” she added.
Ng noted that on a full-year basis, MLT’s borrowing costs have risen by about S$6 million.

MLT’s gross revenue rose 7.7 per cent to S$730.6 million for FY22/23, while net property income (NPI) was 7.2 per cent higher at S$634.8 million.

The amount distributable to unitholders climbed 10.8 per cent to S$432.9 million, including partial distribution of gains from divestments.
Distribution per unit (DPU) for the full year was 2.5 per cent higher at S$0.09011, compared with S$0.08787 the previous year.

For the fourth quarter, DPU was flat at S$0.02268, as gross revenue dipped 2.2 per cent to S$178.9 million and NPI slipped 1.8 per cent to S$154.3 million.

Ng said forex losses – largely due to the depreciation of foreign currencies such as the Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, South Korean won and Australian dollar against the Singapore dollar – accounted for some S$10 million of the gross revenue decline in Q4.

“The part that we are most concerned about is, as our portfolio continues to deliver – in local currency terms – stable, resilient growth, what will hit us will be the forex and borrowing costs,” Ng said.

As at end-March, MLT’s total debt stood at S$4.9 billion with an aggregate leverage ratio of 36.8 per cent.

Its weighted average annualised interest rate climbed to 2.7 per cent, from 2.2 per cent as at Mar 31, 2022.

Some 84 per cent of its debt has been hedged into fixed rates, and 77 per cent of its income stream for the next 12 months has been hedged in Singapore dollars.

“On the DPU front, the part that hits us in a huge way (is forex),” Ng said. “That’s the one that worries me the most because that’s something that we have limited control over and that’s something that I don’t have very clear visibility.”
Meanwhile, the real estate investment trust (Reit) manager said China “continues to be a weak spot” that it will be “very vigilant” about.
Ng added that the manager is looking at divesting some of its assets in China with “limited potential”.
China accounts for 20.8 per cent of MLT’s S$12.8 billion in assets under management, and 22.1 per cent of its FY22/23 gross revenue.
“On the operating front, China is the weakest link,” Ng said. “But overall, it is only 20-odd per cent… So in local currency terms, I don’t see China dragging the portfolio down in a significant way.”
“MLT’s Q4 results painted a relatively healthy operational performance with marginally better positive rent reversion and solid occupancy, but currency weakness continued to be a drag on DPU and portfolio valuation,” said Citi analyst Brandon Lee.
“On the bright side, logistics cap rate appears to be still undergoing marginal cap rate compression – aside from Australia – despite higher interest rates,” he added.
Lee has a “neutral” call on MLT with a target price of S$1.59.
Units of MLT closed at S$1.75 on Tuesday, up 0.6 per cent or S$0.01."

Managers at other Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) should take note.

On Apr 25, at the Reit’s annual general meeting (AGM), a resolution to allow the manager to issue units and to make or grant convertible instruments failed to get through. Votes against the resolution represented 57.86 per cent of total units voted at the AGM.

Among those who have been following Sabana Reit’s ups and downs, the conclusion of the AGM may have been unsurprising. It had also lost its general mandate in 2017, and it had lately been the target of a campaign by an investor – Quarz Capital – that wants to see some changes at the Reit.


In the Singapore investment scene, however, it is rare that AGM resolutions do not pass. In fact, some resolutions are passed with a favourable voting share of 100 per cent. Most pass with votes of 90 per cent or more in favour.

One reason for this voting pattern is that many Singapore-listed entities are controlled by a family, an entrepreneur or a large state-backed investor. These controlling shareholders tend to support resolutions put forth by the board, and few minority shareholders can be bothered to cast their votes in AGMs.

For that reason, voting percentages that are anything less than 90 per cent are worth some attention. No doubt, a small group of shareholders should not, on their own, set the course for a board. But questions can be asked about why this is the case.
In the case of Singapore’s real estate investment trusts, boards should be asking themselves why the general mandate is unpopular.

Data compiled by The Business Times (BT) shows more unitholders voting against giving Reit managers the authority to issue new units via rights issues or placements as well as to make or grant convertible instruments. This is also known as the general mandate.

Of the 40 actively traded S-Reits, 29 held their AGMs over the past month. On average, only 92.8 per cent of the share of votes at these AGMs were in favour of the general mandate resolution.

In contrast, close to 100 per cent of unitholders typically vote in support of other resolutions tabled at these AGMs – such as to adopt the audited financial statements and for the appointment of external auditors.

Seven S-Reits – or nearly a quarter of those that held their AGMs in April – saw more than 10 per cent of unitholders present vote against giving the Reit managers the general mandate.


Another example of an S-Reit that received low unitholder support for its general mandate is Keppel Pacific Oak US Trust : CMOU +5% (Kore). Only 64.9 per cent of unitholders at the AGM voted in favour of the resolution – a steep decline from the 96.11 per cent of favourable votes garnered the previous year.

Kore’s US office peers Manulife US Reit : BTOU +4% and Prime US Reit : OXMU +1.71% were also among the seven S-Reits that received low unitholder support for the issuance of new units.

This is understandable. Investors are less likely to be happy about the Reit managers offering new units – often at a discount to the current trading price – when the counter has been hammered down.

Apart from being highly dilutive, new issues have tended to depress valuations further.

Already, units of the trio of US office Reits have fallen by between 49 per cent and 71.4 per cent over the past 12 months.

Most Reit managers would argue that taking away the authority to issue new units could be detrimental to a Reit. The inability to conduct equity fundraising until the next AGM a year later could see the Reit hamstrung and unable to capitalise on opportunities – or worse, save itself from ruin.

“I’ve not had to issue new units in the past two years,” one S-Reit manager told BT in an informal meeting. “But it’s still good to have (the general mandate).”

“Just because I can drive a car with one hand doesn’t mean I want to do so with one arm tied behind my back,” the manager added.

But investors, in these uncertain times, are starting to question the motivations of managers.

In an open letter to Sabana Reit’s management and board of directors before its AGM, activist investment firm Quarz Capital suggested Sabana Reit could finance future acquisitions internally given its available debt headroom and low aggregate leverage. Quarz therefore argued that the general mandate is not necessary.

A mandate makes it easier for a manager to buy assets without going to unitholders for approval, which may put unitholder interests at odds with the interests of managers. Managers are paid a fee just to acquire a property, whereas unitholders only see a return if the acquisition is accretive to distributions on a per-unit basis post any equity fundraising.

Would S-Reit investors be better served under an internally managed model? Perhaps. But there are no internally managed Reits listed in Singapore.

Meanwhile, would you voluntarily hand your wallet to someone you do not trust? Or get into a car with a driver you believe is out to hurt you?

If investors do not have conviction that a Reit manager’s interests are aligned with their own, perhaps they ought to put their money somewhere else."
2023-05-04,FLCT posts 8.6% lower H1 DPU of S$0.0352 on foreign exchange weakness,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/flct-posts-86-lower-h1-dpu-s00352-foreign-exchange-weakness,"FRASERS Logistics and Commercial Trust (FLCT) : BUOU +0.93%posted an 8.6 per cent decline in distribution per unit (DPU) to S$0.0352 for its first half ended Mar 31, from S$0.0385 the year before.

Revenue fell by 11.7 per cent to S$208 million for the half year, from S$235.7 million previously, said FLCT’s manager on Thursday (May 4).

It attributed the lower DPU to foreign exchange weakness against the Singapore dollar, as overseas assets in Australia, Europe and the UK represented 90.2 per cent of FLCT’s portfolio value.


The lower topline figures were also due to the divestment of Cross Street Exchange in Singapore in 2022, and the absence of an early surrender fee from Farnborough Business Park in the UK in H1 FY2023.

Net property income (NPI) fell to S$157.9 million for H1, representing a 14 per cent decline from the year before. Excluding straight lining adjustments for rental income and adding lease payments of right-of-use assets, adjusted NPI stood at S$155.9 million for the period.

Distributable income fell 8 per cent on year to S$130.8 million, from S$142.1 million previously. Capital distribution for H1 includes the distribution of S$4.3 million in divestment gains.
The distribution will be paid on Jun 15, after the record date of May 12.
FLCT’s occupancy rate stood at 95.9 per cent as at Mar 31, with a weighted average lease expiry of 4.5 years.

During the half-year period, it completed the development of two logistic and industrial properties in Blythe Valley Park and Worcester.

FLCT maintained a healthy aggregate leverage at 27.8 per cent for H1, although finance costs remained elevated due to higher interest costs on borrowing.

The manager remained optimistic about its logistics and industrial-focused portfolio, as well as its healthy balance sheet."
2023-05-08,Paragon Reit Q1 gross revenue rises 0.6% to S$72 million,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/paragon-reit-q1-gross-revenue-rises-06-s72-million,"PARAGON Reit : SK6U +1.23% reported on Monday (May 8) a 0.6 per cent year-on-year increase in first-quarter gross revenue for its portfolio on the back of higher revenue both in Singapore and Australia.

In a business update filed on the Singapore Exchange, the real estate investment trust’s manager said that portfolio gross revenue had increased to S$72 million for the three months ended Mar 31, 2023, from S$71.6 million in the year-ago period.

In local currency terms, Singapore assets gross revenue grew 0.7 per cent on year, while Australia assets gross revenue rose 8.1 per cent year on year, the manager said. However, the Australian dollar had a weaker exchange rate against the Singapore dollar in Q1 FY23 compared to a year earlier.
For its Singapore properties – which includes Paragon, The Clementi Mall and The Rail Mall – tenant sales rose 12 per cent on year in the first quarter, while footfall was up 37 per cent on year.

This was mainly due to pandemic restrictions that were still in place during the prior year period.

Similarly in Australia, tenant sales and footfall rose 21 per cent and 6 per cent on year respectively during the first quarter as pandemic restrictions eased.
The manager noted that there was “near full occupancy” across its portfolio, and a weighted average lease expiry of 5.3 years by net lettable area.

Paragon Reit rose 0.5 per cent to close at S$0.95 on Monday, before the business update.

2023-05-10,Sasseur Reit Q1 DPU up 1.5% to S$0.01849 after retention,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/sasseur-reit-q1-dpu-15-s001849-after-retention,"Sasseur Real Estate Investment Trust : CRPU +1.53% (Sasseur Reit), which owns outlet malls in China, posted a distribution per unit (DPU) of S$0.01849 for the first quarter ended Mar 31 – a 1.5 per cent increase from the previous year.

This comes after a retention of 3.8 per cent or S$900,000 of distributable income for working capital purposes, according to a bourse filing on Wednesday (May 10).

The manager of the real estate investment trust (Reit) attributed the DPU – the highest it has recorded for Q1 since its listing – to strong sales performance. Outlet sales for the quarter rose 17.9 per cent on the year to 1.3 billion yuan (S$249.2 million), boosted by pent-up consumer spending.


Rental income under the Reit’s entrusted management agreement model fell 2.1 per cent to S$33.1 million for Q1 2023, with gains from the 7.7 per cent rise in rental income in yuan eroded by the depreciation of the currency against the Singapore dollar.

Distributable income fell 4 per cent to S$23.7 million, from S$24.7 million previously.
Portfolio occupancy rose slightly to 96.6 per cent, from 95.4 per cent in Q1 2022, driven by an increase in occupancy in Chongqing Bishan.

Weighted average lease expiry stood at 2.1 years by net lettable area. To optimise tenant mix, short leases were chosen to adapt to the fast-changing consumer preferences in China and provide flexibility in replacing non-performing tenants.

The Reit maintained a prudent aggregate leverage of 25.7 per cent.

The manager is optimistic that the Reit’s entrusted management agreement model positions it well to capture China’s post-pandemic recovery in consumer spending.

Units of the Reit closed 2 per cent or S$0.015 lower at S$0.72 on Tuesday.

CLI’s fund management business includes 36 private funds and six listed real estate investment trusts (Reits) and business trusts, of which five are listed in Singapore.

Aside from CapitaLand Ascendas Reit : A17U +1.52% (CLAR) which did not disclose financial results in a first-quarter 2023 business update, CLI noted that several of its Singapore listed funds saw year-on-year improvements in Q1 2023 financials.

CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U +1.69% (CICT)‘s Q1 2023 net property income (NPI) reached S$276.3 million, increasing 11.3 per cent year on year due to contribution from acquisitions completed in the first half of 2022, but offset by higher operating expenses and absence of income from JCube mall.
CapitaLand India Trust : CY6U 0%(CLINT) reported Q1 2023 NPI of S$42.0 million, up 5 per cent year on year, due to higher occupancy and additional income contributions from Arshiya Warehouse 7, Industrial Facility at MWC and Block A.

CapitaLand Ascott Trust : HMN +1.69% (CLAS) saw Q1 2023 gross profit increase by 59 per cent year on year due to stronger operating performance and contributions from new properties.

CLI also observed significant operational improvement in the listed funds, particularly in retail and lodging sectors. Both CICT and CapitaLand China Trust : AU8U +1.17% (CLCT) saw double-digit year-on-year increase in shopper traffic and tenant sales. Similarly, CLAS reported 90 per cent year-on-year increase in revenue per available unit (RevPAU) on higher occupancies and room rates.
While CLCT reported a 1.6 per cent decrease in NPI for Q1 2023 on a year-on-year basis, it noted strong recovery momentum. CLCT’s retail occupancy increased to 96.4 per cent in Q1 2023, up from 95.4 per cent in Dec 2022. Shopper traffic and tenant sales increased 10.6 per cent and 15.4 per cent year on year, respectively.

CLI noted that all its listed funds have maintained healthy balance sheets, with well-managed debt maturity profiles and over 75 per cent of debt based on fixed interest rates.

The five trusts have an average gearing ratio of 39 per cent as at 31 Mar, 2023. Among them, CICT had the highest gearing ratio at 41 per cent while CLAR had the lowest at 38 per cent.

2023-05-21,S-Reit acquisitions continue with Clar’s S$218 million buy,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/s-reit-acquisitions-continue-clars-s218-million-buy,"EARLIER last week, CapitaLand Ascendas Reit : A17U +1.52% (Clar) announced the proposed acquisition of an integrated high-specification research and development (R&D) facility and business park property from Seagate Singapore International Headquarters for a purchase consideration of S$218.2 million.

The purchase represents a 5.1 per cent discount to the independent market valuation of the property of S$230.0 million.

This brings the total count to five acquisitions which have been announced this year to date ending May 18, with a combined value exceeding S$2 billion.
These deals were made across various property types such as business parks, hotels, logistics, and retail assets, which span across Australia, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and the United States.

Among the five announced acquisitions, three of the largest announced were by Mapletree Logistics Trust : M44U +1.94%(MLT), Frasers Centrepoint Trust : J69U +1.91% (FCT) and Clar.

In April, MLT announced the acquisition of six logistics assets located in Japan, and one logistics property in Sydney, Australia. The trust also entered into a binding memorandum of understanding for the acquisition of a logistics property in Seoul, South Korea.
MLT in May announced that it has entered into a sale-and-purchase agreement of the logistics asset in Seoul, South Korea. The total purchase consideration of S$913.6 million of the eight logistics properties is an average 4.0 per cent discount to the properties’ total independent appraised value of S$972.7 million.

Clar’s latest acquisition, Seagate Singapore’s facility, is located at 26 Ayer Rajah Crescent in the one-north district in Singapore. The district is a key research and innovation business hub fostering R&D and high-technology activities in biomedical and life sciences, infocomm technology, media, science and engineering.

Clar currently has five assets in the one-north district and the completion of the proposed acquisition will further expand the real estate investment trust’s footprint in the one-north district by 13 per cent to S$1.9 billion in assets under management and by 21 per cent to 2.5 million square feet in net lettable area.

Upon completion, the proportion of Business Space and Life Sciences properties will increase to 49 per cent or S$8.1 billion of Clar’s total investment properties valued at S$16.7 billion.

Seagate Singapore will enter into a 10-year leaseback of the property’s entire gross floor area, with the option to renew for an additional 10 years. The long lease term with built-in rent escalation of 2.5 per cent per annum is expected to provide stability and resilience to the portfolio.

The acquisition is expected to be yield accretive and the pro forma impact on distribution per unit (DPU) is estimated to be an improvement of 0.110 Singapore cents or a DPU accretion of 0.7 per cent, assuming the transaction was completed on Jan 1, 2022. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2023.

Together with Frasers Property Group in January, FCT announced a proposed joint acquisition to acquire 50.0 per cent interest in suburban retail mall Nex for S$652.5 million.

The trust notes that the investment in Nex further strengthens its focus in the suburban retail segment, where FCT already has an established platform and strong capabilities."
2023-05-22,S-Reits’ operating performance robust in Q1 but some macroeconomic headwinds remain,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/s-reits-operating-performance-robust-q1-some-macroeconomic-headwinds-remain,"SINGAPORE-LISTED real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) mostly delivered robust operating performance for the first quarter of 2023, with stable occupancy rates and positive rental reversions.

Even though the sector continued to face headwinds from higher borrowing costs and adverse foreign exchange movements, analysts remain optimistic that S-Reits are in a better position for recovery given the potential pause in interest rate hikes.

Of the 32 S-Reits that provided gross revenue figures in the latest reporting period, 23 reported an improvement while nine saw their top line decline.
Hospitality S-Reits were among the outperformers as the sector benefited from the recovery in travel with strong growth in revenue per available room (RevPAR)

“Hospitality S-Reits continue to impress with sustained RevPAR growth and levels that exceed pre-Covid levels with more strength anticipated on the back of China’s travel reopening,” DBS Group Research analysts Derek Tan, Rachel Tan, Dale Lai and Geraldine Wong said in a note.

Frasers Hospitality Trust (FHT) posted a 41 .1 per cent year-on-year increase in gross revenue for the first half ended Mar 31, while distribution per stapled security also rose nearly 80 per cent on year.
Other hospitality players, including CDL Hospitality Trusts and Far East Hospitality Trust, also reported stronger gross revenue in Q1, rising 31.5 per cent and 20.1 per cent, respectively, as RevPar rose across most of their portfolios.

Meanwhile, CapitaLand Ascott Trust said in a business update that its gross profit was up 59 per cent on year, while revenue per available unit (RevPau) also improved 90 per cent on year.

“While Q1 2023 is generally seen as a ‘shoulder season’ before the peak travel (corporate and leisure) season kicks in in Q2-Q3, forward guidances were generally optimistic with signs that average daily rates can hold above pre-Covid levels,” the DBS analysts said.

They also noted that industrial Reits were showing strength, with robust operational numbers, including high portfolio occupancy and an acceleration in rental reversion growth.

CGS-CIMB analysts Lock Mun Yee and Natalie Ong observed that industrial S-Reits reported robust portfolio occupancy in the first quarter of 2023, ranging from 92.1 per cent to 98 per cent.

However, they added that most industrial Reits have a geographically diversified portfolio, with negative forex impact on earnings and asset valuations one of the near-term risks.

The larger industrial S-Reits – which are also Straits Times Index (STI) constituents – mostly reported weaker topline numbers in the latest period.

Mapletree Logistics Trust’s gross revenue for its fourth quarter ended March fell 2.2 per cent on year to S$178.9 million. This was largely due to the impact from depreciation of foreign currencies against the Singapore dollar, and the trust’s manager also warned of more uncertainty ahead as higher interest rates and foreign exchange fluctuations could continue to impact performance.

Meanwhile, Mapletree Industrial Trust reported a 4.3 per cent year-on-year increase in gross revenue for Q4, but said DPU fell 4.6 per cent. Its manager cited the “challenging” macroeconomic environment and higher borrowing costs as factors affecting financial performance.

Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust reported lower gross revenue and distributions for its first half following the divestment of Cross Street Exchange, and weaker exchange rates from foreign currencies.

CapitaLand Ascendas Reit did not disclose its revenue or net property income in its quarterly business update, but the manager said aggregate leverage increased slightly from 36.3 per cent to 38.2 per cent. Its portfolio booked a positive rental reversion of 11.1 per cent in the quarter.

The CGS-CIMB analysts noted that industrial Reits have been resilient for the year to date, and they believe that industrial and retail Reits may rally further. “Rent reversions for both these segments are expected to remain positive, albeit at a more moderate pace going forward,” they said.

Frasers Centrepoint Trust’s retail portfolio committed occupancy hit a high of 99.2 per cent, with improved gross revenue and net property income in its fiscal first half.

CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust also reported in its business update an improvement in portfolio committed occupancy and an 11.3 per cent year-on-year improvement in net property income for the first quarter.

The DBS analysts noted that retail-focused S-Reits were showing strength as rental reversions were supported by a general recovery in tenant sales above pre-Covid levels. However, they added that the prospect of a slower economic outlook in the second half of this year may be an overhang to the sustainability of rental reversion growth for retail and industrial S-Reits.

The analysts, however, took a more muted view on office S-Reits.

Most of the office S-Reits and business trusts that provided updates on distributable income in the first quarter reported declines.

Prime US Reit, Keppel Pacific Oak US Reit and Elite Commercial Trust all reported over 20 per cent declines in income available for distribution during the quarter amid higher financing costs.

“We remain cautious on the office sector as the high interest rate environment weighs in on its capital structure and balance sheets,” the DBS analysts said. “With a more cautious economic environment, we believe that investors should be looking to position in sectors that can deliver earnings resilience in a low growth environment.”

DBS prefers logistics and retail Reits “for their ability to grow revenues and, at the same time, having more resilient capital structure metrics in the face of a prolonged high interest rate environment”.

Meanwhile, the CGS-CIMB analysts said they remain overweight on Reits, with “preference for industrial, retail, hospitality and office sub-sectors, in this order”.

“We prefer S-Reits that we believe can deliver organic growth in excess of rising funding cost, leading to DPU and yield improvement,” they said.

“While rates may stay high in the near term, an end to the rate hike cycle should allay refinancing and asset value concerns, thus leading to a positive knock-on impact on S-Reits’ cost of capital and spur inorganic growth prospects going forward.”"
2023-05-23,S-Reit investors wary of falling NAVs as interest rates weigh on sentiment,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/s-reit-investors-wary-falling-navs-interest-rates-weigh-sentiment,"DECLINING net asset values (NAVs) of Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) are among the top concerns for investors, as portfolio valuations weaken and debt ratios continue to creep up.

Based on data compiled by The Business Times (BT), the managers of 14 of the 27 S-Reits that conducted their annual general meetings (AGMs) over the past month faced questions regarding NAV performance. Unitholders of another six S-Reits voiced concerns over asset valuations.

“We understand why NAV per unit is important to some investors – it is widely associated with the underlying value of a Reit’s real estate assets,” said Morningstar analyst Xavier Lee. “As the value of a Reit’s portfolio appreciates over time, its NAV would grow – all else equal.”
NAV is derived by taking the estimated market value of a Reit’s total assets minus the total value of its liabilities.

When divided by the number of units outstanding, NAV per unit is regarded as a useful guide in determining a Reit’s appropriate traded unit price.

A decline in NAV per unit suggests the value of an investor’s unitholdings should be lower, and vice versa.
In this light, it is no wonder that unitholders of nearly three-quarters of the S-Reits raised questions about NAV or asset valuations at their respective AGMs.

“Falling NAV is one of the things I am watching closely because it will affect the share price,” said independent financial adviser and Reits specialist Kenny Loh.

He noted that Reits with a big drop in NAV – especially those with assets in the United States, Europe and the United Kingdom – have performed poorly.

Of the 22 S-Reits that disclosed NAV per unit figures for the latest quarter ended March, 17 – or over 77 per cent – reported a year-on-year (yoy) decline.

On a quarter-on-quarter basis, close to 74 per cent of the S-Reits that disclosed relevant NAV per unit values posted a drop.

The way Loh sees it, the decline in NAV is “expected” in the current macro environment – as property valuers price in the terminal Fed funds rate into the capitalisation rate.

“In addition, there are very few commercial property transactions under the high interest rate environment, which makes it more challenging for price discovery,” he said.

Morningstar’s Lee agreed that property valuations could be “highly subjective”.

“There is no guarantee that a Reit may be able to divest and capture that entire value reported on the balance sheet,” he said. “When looking at the risk of falling NAV, investors will have to consider if the valuation of the Reit’s underlying assets still holds in the current market environment.”

Lee noted that asset classes or geographies that are more at risk of falling NAV are those that have already experienced capitalisation rate expansion, as well as those saddled with weak market demand and supply dynamics. The capitalisation rate measures a property’s yield, or its income, as a percentage of its asset value.

“The valuation of those Reits with portfolios in Singapore are not affected very much across all sectors,” Loh added. “In general, property in Singapore either has a flat valuation or slight increase in valuation yoy.”

In addition, Maybank analyst Krishna Guha noted that NAVs for some S-Reits with assets primarily based overseas have been negatively impacted by adverse foreign exchange movements.

“We have witnessed declining asset values for offshore assets primarily in the commercial sub-sector,” Guha said.

About a third – or seven out of 22 – of the S-Reits that reported NAV per unit figures in the latest period posted double-digit percentage yoy declines. The majority of these – including EC World Reit : BWCU 0%, Lippo Malls Indonesia Retail Trust : D5IU 0% and Elite Commercial Reit : MXNU -2.04% – have assets outside Singapore.

“While this is expected given the current macro challenges, the key is to be watchful on whether the trends are mean-reverting or not, and whether circumstances force some realisation of NAV losses,” Guha said.

Analysts BT spoke to were quick to add, however, that investors should not fixate on NAV figures.

“We think that a Reit’s credit metrics are worth paying more attention to under the current high interest rate environment. These would be metrics such as a Reit’s aggregate leverage and interest coverage ratio,” Lee said.

On top of these, Guha said other key metrics to follow are the Reit’s distribution per unit and hedging policy.

“Amid all the negative news, I am watching for the turnaround signs after the peaking of interest rates,” Loh added. “Some of the S-Reits have started on an uptrend and entered into bullish territory based on technical (indicators); the laggards will catch up eventually.”"
2023-05-25,CapitaLand Ascendas Reit’s recent buy highlights risk of buying properties with short lease,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/capitaland-ascendas-reits-recent-buy-highlights-risk-buying-properties,"SOME investors are shunning listed real estate investment trusts (Reits) as interest rates rise. Equity raising for Reits is much more difficult today.

Kudos, then, to the manager of CapitaLand Ascendas Reit : A17U +1.52% (Clar). The business space and industrial Reit recently closed a private placement that was upsized from S$450 million to S$500 million. As a unitholder, I am pleased the trust has strengthened its balance sheet.

The issue price of the new units under the private placement is S$2.727 per unit. The pricing represented a discount of 3 per cent to the volume-weighted average price of the units traded in the day prior to launch of the placement, less estimated advanced distribution.
About 28 per cent of gross proceeds raised from the private placement will be used to partially fund Clar’s proposed purchase of The Shugart and associated costs.

The Shugart is a high-specification research and development facility and business park property in the one-north area. Clar is buying the property from Seagate Singapore for S$218.2 million. Including transaction costs, the total acquisition cost is S$232.4 million.

Seagate will lease back the property for 10 years, with an option for an additional 10 years. Rental escalation will be at 2.5 per cent per annum.
The Shugart buy is expected to be accretive to Clar’s distribution per unit (DPU). Initial net property income (NPI) yield is 8.3 per cent on the purchase price and 7.8 per cent on the total acquisition cost.

Short land lease
Of some concern, however, is whether the annual rental escalation of 2.5 per cent is sufficient to hedge against inflation. Additionally, The Shugart sits on land with about 20 years of lease outstanding.

As at end-2022, the weighted average land lease to expiry for Clar’s portfolio of properties, excluding freehold properties, was 41.8 years. By value, about 88 per cent of the trust’s portfolio had a remaining land lease tenure of over 30 years.

Among Clar’s business park and life sciences properties, The Shugart will have the shortest land lease outstanding.

At some point, Clar’s manager can approach JTC, which is the government agency in charge of Singapore’s industrial progress, to extend The Shugart’s land lease. But Clar’s acquisition could be worth nothing after 20 years if the land lease is not extended.

Of course, Clar can enjoy 20 years of rental income to recoup its investment in The Shugart. Assuming NPI grows at 2.5 per cent per annum, Clar breaks even on total acquisition cost based on a discount rate of 7 per cent under my simulation.

A discount rate of 7 per cent is below the range of discount rates of 7.25 per cent to 7.75 per cent used to value Clar’s Singapore assets as at end-2022 under the discounted cash flow method.

Should the appropriate discount rate be higher amid rising interest rates? Clar’s buy of The Shugart may appear unwise when a higher discount rate is applied.

Moreover, there is a risk that Seagate will not renew its lease after 10 years. In this case, if the property is left with 10 years on its land lease, its appeal to another buyer or tenant may be limited. Also, it may be difficult for Clar’s manager to justify incurring major capital expenditure at that point to reposition the property.

One way to get better yield in the Singapore property market is to buy properties with shorter land lease outstanding. But the danger with owning such assets is that the income contribution from the assets could fairly quickly become zero once the land lease expires.

Capital appreciation
Many property investors buy assets here with an eye on capital appreciation. Indeed, various Reits have successfully sold Singapore properties at above market valuations. In turn, investors in the said Reits have enjoyed capital gains – which in some cases have resulted in higher DPU.

Versus book value, Clar trades much better than its fellow heavyweight among Singapore Reits, CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U +1.69% (CICT). CICT, however, owns Singapore assets with generally longer land leases. Perhaps, there is greater scope for capital gains with CICT’s Singapore portfolio versus Clar’s.

Are investors too complacent over the risk of land lease decay in Clar’s portfolio?

Certainly, Clar’s size will help mitigate risks associated with income evaporating when any single property’s land lease expires.

Post acquiring The Shugart, Clar will own around S$16.7 billion of assets. In perspective, The Shugart accounts for slightly over 1 per cent of total assets.

Clar’s manager should be able to grow income organically from the rest of the portfolio, plus make acquisitions, to deal with the void caused by any one property stopping income contribution.

Higher interest rates hurt Reits. Financing costs rise, which can affect DPU. Higher discount rates are used to value Reits, which depress unit prices.

Some Reit managers may, under pressure, be tempted to indiscriminately buy properties with short land leases – so DPU gets bumped up near term. Such acquisitions can benefit the mangers as they stand to earn acquisition fees, plus higher recurring management fees due to growing assets under management.

Investors will have to be vigilant over the land lease to expiry of property portfolios of Reits. Managers of Reits need to ensure that the weighted average land lease to expiry of property portfolios are not too short so that retail investors, who are banking on Reits to fund retirement needs as they live longer, can have peace of mind.

2023-06-08,Quarz requisitions EGM to remove Sabana Reit’s manager in favour of internalisation,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/quarz-requisitions-egm-remove-sabana-reits-manager-favour-internalisation,"ACTIVIST investor Quarz Capital has requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to remove the manager of Sabana Industrial Real Estate Investment Trust : M1GU -1.28% (Sabana Reit) in favour of an internal manager.

In a letter dated Jun 7 seen by The Business Times (BT), Quarz requested for the board of Sabana Reit to convene an EGM to pass two resolutions.

The first is to remove Sabana Real Estate Investment Management as manager of Sabana Reit as soon as practicable.


The second resolution seeks to effect the internalisation of the Reit management function by incorporating a subsidiary wholly owned by the trustee and appointing such a subsidiary to act as the manager of Sabana Reit.

Quarz also wants the trustee to “hire and appoint qualified candidates as directors and staff of the internal manager” and “consider the retention of Sabana Reit’s existing staff in order to maintain the continuity of Sabana Reit’s operations”.

In its letter, Quarz said that internalisation of the manager would bring benefits to unitholders by providing cost savings once the external manager is removed.
“The replacement of the ESR Group-owned external manager by an internal manager will resolve the potential corporate governance flaws and can potentially result in higher distribution per unit (DPU) and unit price to Sabana unitholders in the future,” Quarz noted.

It estimates that there would be cost savings of around S$7.3 million of fees and net profit “which unitholders currently pay to the external manager and its shareholder, ESR Group”.

Quarz added: “The removal of the external manager will also likely eliminate all other fees such as performance, acquisition, divestment, lease and property management fees which need to be paid by unitholders to the external manager.”

Quarz indicated that the new internal manager will be fully owned by unitholders, and there would be better alignment of interest.

Quarz pointed out that the external manager model presents a “potential misalignment of interests” between the external manager and unitholders.

It highlighted that an external manager can increase the profitability of its sponsor by: increasing acquisition fees from doing more acquisitions; increasing management fees by acquiring and enlarging the portfolio; or acquiring the sponsor’s properties at a profit for the sponsor’s benefit.

“While an internal manager works to increase the DPU and unit price (for) unitholders, an external manager tends to serve the interests of its owner, namely the sponsor, by increasing its profitability where possible,” Quarz said.

It noted that the majority of Reits in the US and Australia are managed by internal managers. “As the Reit market in the US and Australia have been in existence since the 1970s, the general investors’ sentiments backed by numerous academic studies is that the external manager model tends to underperform the internal manager model, especially in terms of DPU and unit price,” it added.

BT has reached out to the manager of Sabana Reit for comment. The manager said on Jun 8 that it is considering the requisition notice and seeking legal advice.

Units of Sabana Reit closed unchanged at S$0.43 on Wednesday."
2023-06-12,Proposal to internalise Sabana Reit’s manager transfers value from ESR Group to unitholders,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/proposal-internalise-sabana-reits-manager-transfers-value-esr-group-unitholders,"QUARZ Capital has just declared war on ESR Group – that was the reaction of an old hand in Singapore’s real estate investment trust (Reit) sector to news this past week that the activist investor has requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to internalise the manager of Sabana Industrial Reit.

If the resolutions Quarz wants to put forward at the EGM are passed, the current manager of Sabana Reit – a company called Sabana Real Estate Investment Management, which is ultimately owned by Hong Kong-listed ESR Group – will stop receiving fee income from the Reit.

In its place, the Reit’s trustee will set up a separate company and appoint it to act as the Reit’s new manager.


In effect, Quarz is proposing a significant transfer of value away from ESR Group to unitholders of Sabana Reit.

Quarz, in a letter dated Jun 7 to the board of Sabana Reit’s manager, said it expected cost savings from its internalisation proposal to deliver a roughly 7.2 per cent increase in distributions per unit (DPU).

The internalisation push appears to be partly motivated by Quarz’s dissatisfaction with Sabana Reit’s operational performance. Quarz’s letter noted that occupancy rates across the Reit’s portfolio properties over the last few years have been lower than those of its peers and the national average.

The activist investor also grumbled that occupancy rates at some buildings with higher rental rates – such as New Tech Park, Frontech Centre, 8 Commonwealth Lane, and 10 Changi South Street 2 – had fallen despite favourable conditions in the industrial property sector.

In the letter, it offered a laundry list of improvements the new internal manager could pursue to boost Sabana Reit’s performance. This included improving the occupancy rates and adding space at some properties, and undertaking debt-funded acquisitions.

Quarz said it sees potential for the new internal manager to boost Sabana Reit’s DPU over the medium term by almost 60 per cent.

For 2022, Sabana Reit reported flat DPU of 3.05 Singapore cents. Its net asset value (NAV) as at Dec 31 was S$0.53 per unit.

Sabana Reit closed Friday (Jun 9) at S$0.43. Based on its 2022 financial numbers, the Reit is trading at a yield of nearly 7.1 per cent, and an 18.9 per cent discount to NAV.

Volare, Quarz increased stakes
The manager of Sabana Reit will probably dispute some of Quarz’s assertions about the Reit’s operational performance.

For instance, Quarz said in its letter that Sabana Reit’s portfolio occupancy was 88.2 per cent at end-2022. But the manager of Sabana Reit has reported a portfolio occupancy rate at end-2022 of 91.2 per cent – excluding its property at 1 Tuas Avenue 4, which is currently vacant and going through an asset enhancement initiative.

The market value of Sabana Reit’s units has also held up quite well over the past year, despite rising interest rates and concerns about slowing economic growth. Over the past 12 months, Sabana Reit’s units have delivered a total return of 2.4 per cent. By comparison, Mapletree Logistics Trust returned 3.1 per cent, while Mapletree Industrial Trust returned minus 6.7 per cent. CapitaLand Ascendas Reit returned 0.3 per cent.

Quarz said in its Jun 7 letter, however, that Sabana Reit might have performed more poorly over the last couple of years if its substantial unitholders had not been increasing their stakes.

On Jan 20, Volare Group unveiled a partial offer for 10 per cent of Sabana Reit’s units at S$0.465 apiece. By the close of the offer on Mar 24, valid acceptances had been received for 27.7 per cent of Sabana Reit’s units.

Volare held more than 169.1 million Sabana Reit units following the partial offer, putting its stake in the Reit at more than 15.4 per cent.

On Mar 20, Quarz’s own stake in Sabana Reit breached the 15 per cent level. This came after the purchase of 96,000 units in the market, raising its deemed interest to 164.5 million units.

Still, Sabana Reit’s manager may face an uphill battle arguing against Quarz’s internalisation proposal. In the wake of the pandemic and subsequent steep rise in interest rates, there is more scrutiny of the value that external managers bring to the table.

Moreover, it seems to be widely accepted that internally managed Reits are less susceptible than externally managed ones to issues related to conflicts of interest.

Sabana Reit and ESR-Logos Reit both invest in Singapore industrial properties, and their managers are ultimately owned by ESR Group. Given that ESR-Logos Reit has a market capitalisation more than five times that of Sabana Reit, their sponsor may appear to be incentivised to prioritise the interests of the former over the latter.

Internalising the manager of Sabana Reit would turn ESR Group into just another big unitholder alongside Volare and Quarz, thus mitigating this problem of overlapping mandates.

ESR Group’s fees, distributions
In 2020, Quarz waged a bruising campaign to prevent Sabana Reit from being merged with ESR-Reit on terms that were plainly unfair. Since then, Quarz has repeatedly criticised Sabana Reit’s performance and questioned the appointment of various directors to the board of the Reit’s manager.

Quarz also mobilised unitholders of Sabana Reit to vote against Resolution 4 at its annual general meeting on Apr 25. The resolution, which would have authorised the manager to issue new units, failed to pass, with 42.14 per cent of units voting for it and 57.86 per cent of units voting against it.

Without the mandate to issue new units, the manager of Sabana Reit will have to obtain permission from unitholders whenever it needs to raise equity funding. This has arguably reduced the usefulness of Sabana Reit as a property securitisation platform, and made it less likely for ESR Group to obtain a high valuation for its manager in any potential sale.

Under the circumstances, the relevance of the Sabana Reit platform to ESR Group is probably now financial rather than strategic. While ESR Group would certainly be ill-disposed to surrendering the fee income it collects from Sabana Reit every year, it would stand to benefit somewhat from the Reit’s increased profitability in the event that Quarz’s proposal is implemented.

ESR Group held more than 226.8 million units in Sabana Reit as at Mar 8, representing a nearly 20.7 per cent stake. ESR Group would therefore have received more than S$6.9 million in distributions from Sabana Reit for 2022.

This was almost equivalent to the nearly S$7.3 million in fees Sabana Reit paid to its sponsor group in 2022 – which comprised S$4.4 million in manager’s fees and S$2.8 million in property and lease management fees.

While it remains to be seen how ESR Group reacts to Quarz’s proposal to internalise the manager of Sabana Reit, it already seems clear this episode will mark an interesting milestone in the development of Singapore’s Reit sector.

2023-06-26,ESR Group hits back at Quarz proposal to replace Sabana Reit manager,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/esr-group-hits-back-quarz-proposal-replace-sabana-reit-manager,"ESR Group has hit back at activist investor Quarz Capital’s plan to remove Sabana Industrial Real Estate Investment Trust : M1GU -1.28%’s (Sabana Reit) manager and appoint an internal manager as a replacement.

The Hong Kong-listed asset manager holds a 20.6 per cent interest in Sabana Reit and ultimately owns its manager Sabana Real Estate Investment Management (SREIM).

In an open letter dated Jun 25, ESR Group said it was writing to unitholders to share a number of “grave concerns” it has regarding the internalisation. It also noted Quarz’s requisition letter contains numerous false and inaccurate statements, but reserved its position on those issues.


To recap, Quarz has requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting to pass a first resolution to remove SREIM as manager as soon as practicable.

The next resolution will effect the internalisation of the Reit management function by incorporating a subsidiary wholly owned by the trustee, and appointing such a subsidiary to act as the manager of Sabana Reit.

Quarz said in its letter that replacing the ESR Group-owned external manager with an internal one would resolve the potential corporate governance flaws and potentially result in higher distribution per unit and unit price to Sabana unitholders in the future.
Addressing its ownership of the Reit’s manager, ESR Group said its unitholding in Sabana Reit “far outweighs” the value of its investment in the Reit’s manager. Therefore, there is no reason for ESR Group to prioritise and protect its stake in the manager at the expense of or to the detriment of Sabana Reit.

If the resolutions are passed, ESR Group believes Sabana Reit would be cast into a “prolonged period of uncertainty”, which could result in a loss of confidence in the Reit by investors and lenders. This, in turn, could cause “massive destruction of value” for unitholders.

ESR Group also argued that the removal of the manager would impose onerous duties beyond the usual scope of work on Sabana Reit’s trustee, as there would be no incentive for the manager’s board, management and staff to continue in their office or employment.

It has urged the trustee to provide its views to unitholders and the Reit manager on whether it has the capability and resources to undertake such a scope of work.

A change in manager could also lead to a breach in loan covenants, as Sabana Reit has entered into facilities or financing agreements which contain restrictions on manager change – including SREIM stepping down.

In response to this argument, Quarz said in an e-mail to The Business Times that some Singapore-listed Reits have seen their managers change hands with no publicly announced difficulties from lenders.

Quarz also noted that external managers are under the regulatory purview of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and that the existing manager would act as a caretaker until the new manager is fully licensed and ready to take over the management of Sabana Reit.

Due to the consolidation of the Reit market in recent years, Quarz said, there is a ready pool of qualified personnel for a new manager. Some of these “have already indicated strong interest”, Quarz added.

ESR Group has suggested the following be put in place before the resolutions are put to vote: a new management team and board of directors, and approval for a capital markets services licence for the internal manager, as well as a comprehensive and credible refinancing plan.

Full and proper disclosures on the potential risks, considerations and implications of Quarz’s proposed actions should also be provided for unitholders to make an informed decision.

ESR Group has also proposed that the internalisation resolution be tabled as an extraordinary resolution instead of an ordinary one, as it effectively amounts to an amendment to the trust deed.

It believes the resolution for internalising the manager should also be voted on first, before unitholders vote on the resolution to remove the current manager. Doing otherwise would carry the risk that Sabana Reit would be left without a manager if the removal resolution is approved, but the internalisation resolution fails to pass.

“It bears noting at the outset that the proposed internalisation is unprecedented for a Singapore Reit and is not without risks to unitholders, and should therefore be proceeded with caution,” ESR Group said in its letter.

Quarz, however, noted that an extraordinary resolution would raise the bar required for shareholder approval – from a majority to at least 75 per cent of those voting. "
2023-07-06,Frasers Centrepoint Trust obtains S$419 million green loan with carbon credits from OCBC,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/frasers-centrepoint-trust-obtains-s419-million-green-loan-carbon-credits-ocbc,"FRASERS Centrepoint Trust : J69U +1.91% (FCT) has bagged a S$419 million green loan from OCBC : O39 +0.62% with carbon credits as part of the deal.

On Thursday (Jul 6), both the real estate investment trust’s (Reit) manager and bank said this is Singapore’s first green financing solution that comprises a green loan and carbon credits.

Proceeds from the loan will be used for decarbonisation projects that include procuring energy-efficient technology for Tampines 1, which is in the midst of a S$38 million asset enhancement initiative (AEI).
FCT and OCBC said this would enable the seven-storey mall to progress towards carbon-neutral status, as the mall’s plans to further reduce carbon emissions include the installation of solar panels on its roof in Q4 2023.

Sustainability initiatives in 2024 will focus on enhancing efficiency throughout the mall through Air-Conditioning and Mechanical Ventilation airside optimisation.

Other uses for the loan proceeds include refinancing the trust’s maturing facility, as well as for its AEIs.
FCT will invest the carbon credits, which are sourced through OCBC’s emissions trading desk, in Verra or Gold standard-certified carbon reduction nature-based projects.

The trust aims to reduce carbon in an amount which is on a par with financed emissions associated with the green loan.

It also intends to purchase additional carbon credits to account for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions of Tampines 1’s carbon footprint.

While Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are “residual and unavoidable”, Scope 3 emissions of the mall will encompass all energy-related emissions for landlord and tenant controlled-area consumption. 

“This new financing solution will pave the way for us to support green buildings, while directing more capital towards carbon credit generating projects,” said Elaine Lam, head of global corporate banking at OCBC.

“Through working with FCT and its sponsor Frasers Property Group, we have also achieved a deeper understanding of the sustainability ambitions and needs of our real estate clients, which will allow us to support them better in future.”

FCT units closed on Wednesday S$0.02 or 0.9 per cent lower at S$2.16, and OCBC ended S$0.12 or 1 per cent down at S$12.23."
2023-07-09,Retail investors net buy S$390 million of S-Reits in H1 2023,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/retail-investors-net-buy-s390-million-s-reits-h1-2023,"IN THE first half of 2023, the iEdge S-Reit Index gained 2.1 per cent in total return terms, after a challenging 2022 which saw it decline 12 per cent.

Retail investors continued to be a key driver in S-Reits fund flow activities in H1 2023, accumulating net retail inflows of S$389 million, while institutional investors saw net outflows of S$485 million. A similar trend was seen a year ago during H1 2022 when the sector booked S$443 million of net retail inflows and S$360 million net institutional outflows.

By sub-segments, data centre S-Reits received the most institutional net inflows and retail net outflows in H1 2023, at S$26 million and S$43 million respectively. On the other hand, diversified S-Reits saw the most institutional net outflows during the period at S$348 million, while seeing S$280 million of net retail outflow.
Keppel DC Reit : AJBU +1.47% (KDCReit) was the best performing S-Reit in the first half of 2023 with 25 per cent total returns. It also received the most net institutional inflows in H1 2023 of S$36 million. This was a reversal from a year ago, during H1 2022, where institutional investors were net sellers of the stock with net outflows of S$120 million.

KDCReit’s Q1 2023 net property income grew 6.3 per cent, translating to a 3 per cent growth in distribution per unit for the period. It believes that data centre demand will continue to be driven by long-term trends such as adoption of cloud computing and digital transformation initiatives. It is expected to report H1 2023 results on Jul 24, 2023.

Paragon Reit : SK6U +1.23% booked the second largest net institutional inflows of S$20 million in H1 2023. Institutional investors continued to be net buyers of the Reit following net inflows of S$1 million in H1 2022.
Aside from Paragon Reit, CapitaLand Ascott Trust : HMN +1.69% and Sabana Industrial Reit : M1GU -1.28% also saw significant net inflow from institutional investors in both the H1 2023 and H1 2022 periods.

CapitaLand Ascott Trust received net institutional inflows of S$17 million and S$41 million in H1 2023 and H1 2022 respectively while Sabana Industrial Reit received net institutional inflows of S$5 million and S$9 million in H1 2023 and H1 2022 respectively.

S-Reits which received the most net inflows from retail investors in H1 2023 were Suntec Reit : T82U +0.88% at S$140 million, Lendlease Global Commercial Reit : JYEU -0.97% (LReit) at S$57 million and Keppel Reit : K71U +0.6% at S$52 million. LReit booked net inflows from retail investors during the year-ago period as well, receiving S$11 million in H1 2022."
2023-07-12,ESR-Logos Reit’s manager must justify decision to sell assets below valuation,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/esr-logos-reits-manager-must-justify-decision-sell-assets-below-valuation,"MIGHT ESR-Logos Reit : J91U -1.82% be in financial distress that it needs to be selling assets at a loss?

In late-June, the trust said it is selling seven industrial properties in Singapore and Australia for about S$337 million in total. The proposed sale of assets includes a portfolio of five assets in Singapore, which will be sold for S$313.5 million – a 5.1 per cent discount to the portfolio’s latest valuation of S$330.4 million.

As part of the above proposed divestment, ESR-Logos Reit will provide net property income support for 36 months at an estimated cost of S$4.8 million.
After accounting for the divestment costs and applicable Goods and Services Tax, the net proceeds from the proposed sale of the five assets amount to about S$299.3 million, and the resulting net loss is about S$30.7 million. 

Contrast the above proposed sale of the five assets with the trust’s sale of 49 Pandan Road in the west of Singapore at 15.1 per cent above valuation, which was completed earlier this year.
ESR-Logos Reit looks to be financially healthy. As at end-March, the trust’s gearing was 41.6 per cent, and it had debt headroom of S$859.5 million. The trust’s debt maturity was well staggered and 72.7 per cent of interest rate exposure was fixed.

Maybe ESR-Logos Reit should simply hold on to the five assets – four of which are predominantly warehouses and one of which is mainly an industrial cum warehouse facility. 

If the trust continues owning the said assets, it will not incur any divestment costs. The trust can also hope to achieve better pricing before selling. 

Should interest rates start to stabilise, property buyers may have greater clarity and be more willing to make sizeable investments. Moreover, warehouse assets here benefit from Singapore’s strong positioning as a logistics hub and some shifting in investor demand from homes to non-residential properties because of hefty Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty for residential investors.

Compelling opportunities

Perhaps ESR-Logos Reit is expediting asset sales because its manager sees compelling opportunities to use the proceeds raised.

Chief executive officer and executive director of ESR-Logos Reit’s manager Adrian Chui said the proposed asset sales will enable ESR-Logos Reit to recapitalise for growth as asset valuations begin to correct, and improve portfolio quality with in-demand new-economy assets.

As an ESR-Logos Reit unitholder, I wait eagerly to see if ESR-Logos Reit can make great new purchases. Can the trust make distribution per unit-accretive buys of high-specification modern warehouses in Singapore at below valuation? 

Crucially, ESR-Logos Reit’s manager needs to get investors to re-rate the trust due to its building of a higher-quality portfolio with good growth prospects.

While logistics assets are ESR-Logos Reit’s largest contributor, the trust trades at an inferior book value multiple versus its peer Mapletree Logistics Trust : M44U +1.94%. As at Jul 11, the former traded at a discount to end-December 2022 net asset value (NAV) of 8 per cent, while the latter traded at a premium to end-March 2023 NAV of 13.2 per cent.

Selling assets at opportune times can be key to a listed property trust’s growth strategy. Sell an asset for a juicy premium to valuation. Use proceeds raised to reward unitholders and/or redeploy into exciting new opportunities. All this makes perfect sense.

Deal-related fees

However, selling assets below valuation when a trust is not under financial duress calls for greater scrutiny. 

The interest of the manager of a trust may not be completely aligned with that of unitholders in property transactions. Some managers may be keen to churn assets because they can earn acquisition and divestment fees. 

I object to paying managers such fees. Transacting assets as part of portfolio reconstitution should fall within the normal job scope of any manager of a property trust, who is typically paid recurring fees based on portfolio value and/or income.

Recently, the management arrangements of listed property trusts here have been in the spotlight. Could having internal managers that are owned by unitholders be better than current arrangements of having external managers, which are often owned by sponsors of the trusts?

Activist investor Quarz Capital has requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) – slated for Aug 4 – to remove Sabana Real Estate Investment Management as manager of Sabana Industrial Real Estate Investment Trust : M1GU -1.28% and replace it with an internal manager.

Quarz argues that there will be cost savings from replacing the ESR Group-owned external manager with an internal manager. ESR Group has filed a court application to prevent the holding of this EGM.

Hong Kong-listed ESR Group also owns 99 per cent of the manager of ESR-Logos Reit. Like groups such as CapitaLand Investment : 9CI +1.97%, Mapletree Investments and Frasers Property : TQ5 -1.22%, ESR Group has prospered from owning the manager of listed trusts. Typically, this business generates high-quality recurring fee income and enjoys healthy profit margins.

This lucrative business could be under threat if the listed property trust sector here moves from using external managers to having internal management, which is common in the United States.

As scrutiny grows over the value that external managers bring to listed trusts and higher interest rates dampen the appeal of property trusts, external managers must do more to demonstrate that they are always acting in the best interests of all unitholders as well as deliver good returns for investors. The jobs of external managers will be safe only if they can truly value-add."
2023-07-13,Hearing over contended Sabana Reit EGM set for Jul 19,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/hearing-over-contended-sabana-reit-egm-set-jul-19,"THE Registrar of Singapore’s Supreme Court on Thursday (Jul 13) fixed the hearing for the contended Sabana real estate investment trust (Sabana Reit) extraordinary general meeting (EGM) for 10 am on Jul 19. This was on an expedited basis.

Activist investor Quarz Capital had requisitioned an EGM to remove Sabana Real Estate Investment Management as manager of Sabana Reit, in favour of an internal manager.

In its originating application, ESR Group, the sponsor of Sabana Reit and ultimate owner of the Reit’s manager, sought to have the requisition rendered “invalid and/or ineffectual”.
It also sought a permanent injunction restraining the manager of the Reit from taking any steps to convene an EGM, pursuant to Quarz’ requisition. 

The Singapore High Court had on Tuesday dismissed ESR Group’s application for an interim injunction to block Sabana Reit’s manager from convening the EGM.

ESR Group said that it “took steps to ensure that Quarz is joined in the court action so that all parties can present their positions for the court’s consideration and determination”.
“The objective is for a clear direction to be given to the managers, trustees and unitholders on how to proceed with this requisition or subsequent requisitions. This will provide clarity to all unitholders and prevent a prolonged period of uncertainty,” it added.

The contended EGM is currently set to take place on Aug 4."
2023-07-13,IReit Global preferential offering closes with valid acceptances of 77.3%; total applications at 134.7%,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/ireit-global-preferential-offering-closes-valid-acceptances-773-total,"IReit Global : UD1U +1.39% has received a total of 250.7 million valid acceptances and excess applications, or 134.7 per cent of the total number of preferential offering units available, at the close of its offering on Jul 11. Valid acceptances came to 77.3 per cent.

In a bourse filing on Thursday (Jul 13), the manager said that it received valid acceptances of 143.9 million new units and excess applications of 106.9 million units. A total of about 186.1 million preferential offering units will be issued to raise gross proceeds of S$75.9 million.
The excess applications totalled 57.4 per cent of the amount on offer. The balance of 42.2 million preferential offering units that were not validly accepted will be allotted to satisfy excess applications.
The offering, which was launched on Jun 19, was for 161 preferential offering units for every 1,000 existing units at a price of S$0.408 apiece. It is expected to increase the real estate investment trust’s market capitalisation by about 13.7 per cent, to S$640.7 million.

IReit’s joint sponsors – Tikehau Capital and City Developments (CDL) (through its wholly-owned subsidiary City Strategic Equity) – and the Reit’s manager have each accepted, subscribed and paid in full for its total provisional allotment of the preferential offering units corresponding to its direct interest in IReit.

Tikehau Capital took up 53.5 million preferential offering units, CDL took up 38.6 million, and the manager took up 791,641.
CDL also made an excess application for 59.4 million units, such that when aggregated with its total provisional allotment, its total subscription would amount to approximately S$40 million of preferential offering units.

“As the preferential offering was oversubscribed, (City Strategic Equity) will not be allotted any excess preferential offering units,” said IReit’s manager.

Immediately following the completion of the preferential offering, Tikehau Capital, CDL and the manager will directly hold approximately 28.7 per cent, 20.8 per cent and 0.4 per cent, respectively, of the total number of 1.34 billion units in issue.

The preferential offering units will be listed on the mainboard of the Singapore Exchange from 9 am on Jul 19.

The proceeds will mainly be used to fund the acquisition of 17 retail properties located across France, which are fully let to B&M France, a wholly-owned subsidiary of B&M European Value Retail.

“Post-acquisition, IReit will maintain a healthy aggregate leverage of 33.3 per cent, well below the aggregate leverage limit of 50 per cent, providing it with ample debt headroom for future growth opportunities,” said the manager.

Distribution per unit is expected to increase to 2.31 euro cents, while net asset value per unit will stand at 0.50 euro

Outperformance was driven across specialised, healthcare and hospitality sub-sectors at 7.5 per cent, 5.2 per cent, and 4.1 per cent total returns respectively.

Keppel DC Reit was the best performing S-Reit in the first half of 2023, driven by stronger growth in distributable income and distribution per unit at 4.1 per cent and 3.0 per cent respectively in its first-quarter business update.

Majority of growth was contributed by acquisitions and asset enhancement initiatives, and it has maintained a portfolio occupancy of 98.5 per cent.

Keppel DC Reit also received the most net institutional inflows of S$36 million, reversing from a year ago, where institutional investors net sold S$120 million.

Cromwell E-Reit in its Q1 business update posted that its overall portfolio occupancy grew 100 basis points to 95.8 per cent on the back of 6.7 per cent rent reversion and 76.4 per cent tenant retention rate.

The Reit recently announced that it is divesting its asset in Bari, Italy, in line with its strategy to divest non-core and non-strategic assets over the next two to three years.

This was announced after it was in advanced negotiations to sell its office asset in Milan Italy, which has been completed.
Despite lower revenue and distributable income announced in H1 FY23, Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust maintained portfolio occupancy rate of 95.9 per cent and lower gearing at 27.8 per cent.

Rental reversion for the period January to March 2023 was 3.6 per cent on an incoming rent versus outgoing rent basis and 23.2 per cent on an average rent versus average rent basis."
2023-07-16,"Sabana Reit trustee urges unitholders to vote carefully in EGM, highlights ‘risks and uncertainties’",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/sabana-reit-trustee-urges-unitholders-vote-carefully-egm-highlights-risks-and,"IT IS not clear how much time or money would be needed to replace Sabana Reit’s manager or internalise its management function, should unitholders vote to do so at an upcoming extraordinary general meeting (EGM), the trustee of the real estate investment trust (Reit) said in a draft statement.

The draft statement was contained in a letter sent to Sabana Real Estate Investment Management (SREIM), the Reit manager of Sabana Industrial Real Estate Investment Trust (Sabana Reit), SREIM said on Saturday (Jul 15).

In the letter, HSBC Institutional Trust Services (HSBC Trustee), trustee of Sabana Reit, said it “does not provide any advice or recommendation” to unitholders whether in support of or against the resolutions they are due to vote on at the EGM slated for Aug 4.


Unitholders will vote on two resolutions – first, the removal of SREIM, and second, the internalisation of the Reit management function of Sabana Reit.

If either or both resolutions are passed, the trustee will be directed to implement them without a replacement manager having been identified or an internalised management structure in place to transition the management of Sabana Reit to, HSBC Trustee said.

In the event that resolution 1 is passed and resolution 2 not, HSBC Trustee said: “There is no estimate available of the time it would take to identify a replacement external manager and there can be no assurance that such replacement manager will agree to the same fee structure as SREIM.”
And if resolution 2 is passed instead, “an internalised management structure that does not currently exist will need to be identified, establised and then approved by unitholders”.

HSBC Trustee warned unitholders that “a considerable amount of time” and cost will be required. It added that it is not currently possible to estimate the length of time needed but added that “it is expected to be at least 12 months and potentially significantly longer”.

It would also need to appoint professional advisers – which may include investment, legal, financial, tax, property and other advisers – in the process, HSBC Trustee added. This would be reimbursed out of the assets of Sabana Reit in accordance with the terms of the trust deed.

It also currently expects to hold two or more EGMs to seek unitholders’ directions on these matters.

In the event these resolutions are passed and cannot be implemented in “a reasonable timeframe”, HSBC Trustee said it will “assess all options in the best interests of unitholders”, including an “orderly winding-up of Sabana Reit” or applying for court orders to take such actions.

“It is important that unitholders carefully consider the resolutions and note that there is uncertainty and risks associated with either or both the resolutions,” HSBC Trustee said.

It added that it remains neutral and independent of SREIM, any particular group of unitholders and the lenders of Sabana Reit.

Last week, ESR Group, the sponsor of Sabana Reit, filed for a court order to prevent activist investor Quarz Capital from convening the EGM. The application for the interim injunction was dismissed by the Singapore High Court a few days later.

Meanwhile, the registrar of the Singapore Supreme Court has fixed the hearing for the originating application on Jul 19, at 10 am.

2023-07-17,"Softer earnings expected for S-reits in first half, with funding cost among headwinds",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/softer-earnings-expected-s-reits-first-half-funding-cost-among,"ANALYSTS are expecting muted results from Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) for the first half of 2023. High interest rates and a strong Singapore dollar are among the potential drags on their performance.

Key metrics to watch include property valuations as well as how individual Reits are coping with interest cost pressures and refinancing.

“Overall, we expect a soft earnings report for H1 2023 for the majority of the S-Reits, with the exception of a few in the industrial, healthcare and office/retail sector,” said RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan, who expects many Reits to report lower distributions per unit (DPUs).
Weaker DPUs would likely be due to pressures from rising interest costs outpacing operational gains, he added.

Interest rates globally have risen over the past year as central banks worldwide try to combat elevated inflation.

While the US Federal Reserve last month paused its rate hikes, there are still expectations that rates could go up by another 50 basis points by year-end.
DBS analysts Derek Tan, Rachel Tan, Dale Lai and Geraldine Wong said in a note that an extended period of high rates could result in continued erosion in DPUs until 2024.

“A prolonged period of high interest rates till the end of 2024 would potentially drive portfolio debt costs up by another 30 basis points,” they said, adding that their sensitivity analysis shows up to a 4 per cent decline in DPUs in a scenario of protracted high rates.

Sectors that would be most affected include US offices, China retail and selected office and retail segments, they added.

Maybank analyst Krishna Guha also sees distributions being impacted by funding costs, even though he expects healthy operational metrics for the quarter ended June.

“I expect sequential slowdown in distributions for retail, office and hospitality due to a combination of seasonality, high base effect and normalisation of reopening tailwinds,” he said, adding that valuation and gearing would be the key metrics to watch for, especially valuation of offshore assets.

Reits with offshore assets may also have foreign exchange risks to contend with. Liu Miaomiao, research analyst at Phillip Securities, observed that the stronger Singapore dollar could further add pressure on DPU for Reits with overseas assets.

In such an environment, DBS analysts believe a “conservative stance” is wise, with preference for “resilient” sub-sectors such as industrial or hotel S-Reits that have stronger portfolio cashflows.

Their picks include CapitaLand Ascendas Reit and Mapletree Logistics Trust (MLT). CapitaLand Ascendas Reit will report its first-half results on Jul 31, while MLT will announce its first-quarter results on Jul 25.

Other industrial S-Reits that have announced the date of their financial results include Sabana Reit (Jul 19), Keppel DC Reit (Jul 24), Mapletree Industrial Trust and ESR-Logos Reit (Jul 26), and Digital Core Reit (Jul 27).

The DBS analysts are also expecting suburban retail players to offer better DPU resiliency.

Frasers Centrepoint Trust’s third-quarter business update will be released on Jul 25, while Mapletree PanAsia Commercial Trust will announce its first-quarter results on Jul 31. CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust reports its first-half result on Aug 1, while Lendlease Global Commercial Reit will announce its full-year results on Aug 7.

Most analysts also continue to expect the hospitality segment to outperform.

Phillip Securities’ Liu said: “We remain positive on the hospitality sector as there are more influx of Chinese tourists.”

She added that revenue per available room is expected to rise as more Singapore hotels exit government contracts.

RHB’s Natarajan also believes that there would be a better performance on a year-on-year basis from hospitality, as well as selected industrial and healthcare Reits amid “operational resilience” and rent growth.

“Hospitality sector is likely to be the major outlier with a strong DPU growth on the back of pent-up demand and revenge tourism and a low base effect,” he said.

Hospitality S-Reits scheduled to release their results for the first half ended June include CapitaLand Ascott Trust (Jul 27), and CDL Hospitality Trusts and Far East Hospitality Trust (Jul 28).

Expectations for office Reits, however, are less rosy.

The DBS analysts expect most S-Reits to be able to keep earnings above three times interest expense.

The exception would be office and US office S-Reits, which have higher leverage ratios.

“We anticipate that these S-Reits will likely pursue asset sales or selective fundraising to recapitalise their balance sheets,” they said.

Keppel Reit will release its results on Jul 25, while OUE Commercial Trust, Keppel Pacific Oak and Suntec Reit will announce their earnings on Jul 26.

While financial metrics would be the likely drags on performance in the first half, analysts are also keeping an eye out for operational numbers.

Natarajan said that occupancy or weakness in rental growth arising from the slowing economy in Singapore and globally are areas to watch for.

Meanwhile, Liu noted that rising vacancy rates would place pressure on valuations, with valuation risk more elevated for US office players.

She added: “Rental reversion in office and industrial sector may dampen due to the slower economic activities.”"
2023-07-18,Brokers’ take: Maybank initiates Lendlease Global Reit with ‘buy’ on retail rebound,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/brokers-take-maybank-initiates-lendlease-global-reit-buy-retail-rebound,"LENDLEASE Global Commercial Reit : JYEU -0.97% is “poised to benefit” from resilient domestic consumption and the steady recovery in tourism, Maybank said on Monday (Jul 17).

The research team has initiated a “buy” on the counter with a target price of S$0.80, representing a potential upside of 17.6 per cent from Lendlease Global Reit’s last trading price of S$0.68 as at 11.18 am. Its units were up 0.7 per cent or S$0.005 at the time.

Although funding metrics and macroeconomic conditions are challenging, Maybank believes these obstacles are offset by the real estate investment trust’s (Reit) 7 per cent yield and its 15 per cent discount to book value.
The Reit’s two Singapore assets – JEM and 313@somerset – will likely gain from plans to make Orchard Road the destination of choice for youths and for the Jurong area to be the Republic’s second central business district.

Having a supportive sponsor will also provide ample acquisition opportunities, the research team said. The sponsor, Lendlease Group, has a development pipeline of A$120.6 billion (S$108.8 billion) for the half year ended Dec 31, 2022. It also has A$48 billion of funds under management.

Lendlease Global Reit is the sponsor’s only listed Reit. It also has right-of-first-refusal agreements for any stabilised retail or office assets. Notably, the sponsor owns 30 per cent of Paya Lebar Quarter.
The Reit’s lease structure also offers growth and stability, Maybank said. It highlighted that reversions are up 3.3 per cent in the year to date, based on a business update for the Q3 period ended March.

The research team also expects a 1 per cent accretion in the Reit’s distribution per unit after the repurposed Grange Road car park becomes operational next year.

Units of Lendlease Global Reit closed at S$0.68, up S$0.005 or 0.7 per cent on Tuesday."
2023-07-19,Sabana Reit H1 DPU up 1.3% to S$0.0161 on ‘strong operational performance’,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/sabana-reit-h1-dpu-13-s00161-strong-operational-performance,"SABANA Industrial Real Estate Investment Trust : M1GU 0% (Sabana Reit) posted a distribution per unit (DPU) of S$0.0161 for the first half of its fiscal year ended Jun 30, 2023, up 1.3 per cent from S$0.0159 in the corresponding year-ago period, its manager announced on Wednesday (Jul 19).

Gross revenue for H1 was up 23.2 per cent on year to S$55.3 million from S$44.9 million, mainly due to higher portfolio occupancy of 93.9 per cent. This is 2.6 percentage points higher than the 91.3 per cent recorded in the corresponding year-ago period, and a multi-year high, the manager said.

“The improvement in occupancy rate is underpinned by the strong leasing momentum backed by robust demand from third-party logistics providers in the first half of 2023,” it said.
In a media briefing on Wednesday, Donald Han, chief executive of the manager, said the Reit recorded steady or improved occupancies across all properties on Jun 30 from six months before.

But revenue growth was largely offset by higher property expenses, which grew year on year to S$28.1 million from S$17.8 million. This included higher utility costs. Net property income rose 0.5 per cent to S$27.2 million from S$27 million. 

Total amount available for distribution came in at S$17.8 million, 3.9 per cent higher than the preceding year’s S$17.1 million.
“Despite operational challenges and intensified upheaval in recent months, we have stayed focused and delivered another set of impeccable financial results,” Han said.

“Equally important, our proactive tenant management and leasing strategy, including our focus on rentals, has enabled us to protect our valuation and NAV (net asset value), despite the challenge of declining land tenure.”

The Reit achieved an overall higher portfolio valuation of S$887.5 million as at Jun 30, 2023, from S$885.7 million as at end-December 2022. The Reit is “firmly focused on extracting value from (its) existing portfolio”, Han added.

The Reit is in the second phase of its strategy to “grow value”; it plans to undertake asset-enhancement initiatives and selected rejuvenation of its portfolio.

It is also looking to move into the next phase of the strategy, where it would explore potential yield-accretive acquisitions, including overseas ones. Han said it is hoped that such acquisitions would include assets with longer lease tenures or freehold tenures.

Sabana Reit’s rental reversion for H1 came in at a record 20.1 per cent. It also posted a record 27.1 per cent rental reversion for Q2. The manager added that it has also renewed and replaced 52.5 per cent of its leases expiring in FY2023, with another 23.6 per cent under negotiation or lease documentation.

Han said the manager continues to be confident about certain segments such as warehouse and logistics. Segments like the high-tech industrial segment, however, are dependent on other markets such as the office market.

“If you see a slowdown in the office market, then you see backroom operations starting to slow down as well. And that will impact your business park and your high-tech in that sense,” he said, adding they are keeping an eye on the high-tech segment.

“We want to on-board tenants, and we will maintain our rates as competitive as possible to on-board tenants.The key is really to drive occupancy, and, at the same time, ensure that we end this year with a strong showing,” he said.

As at end-June, aggregate leverage stood at 32.5 per cent, and weighted average all-in cost of borrowing was 3.9 per cent, with 82.2 per cent of total borrowings hedged to fixed rates. The Reit’s weighted average debt maturity stands at 3.3 years, with no refinancing requirements until Q4 2025.

Sabana Reit’s independent auditor indicated an emphasis of matter as there was material uncertainty that may cast “significant doubt” on the Reit’s ability to continue as a going concern, depending on the outcome of an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) requisitioned by activist investor Quarz Capital.

Quarz is proposing that Sabana Real Estate Investment Management be removed as the Reit’s manager, which could affect financing arrangements with various lenders.

The High Court on Wednesday dismissed the originating application in which ESR Group, the ultimate owner of Sabana Reit’s manager, sought to have Quarz’s requisition rendered “invalid and/or ineffectual”. ESR was also unsuccessful in seeking a permanent injunction restraining the manager from taking steps to convene an EGM, pursuant to Quarz’ requisition.

ESR said on Wednesday night that Quarz’s resolution “is merely a direction to the trustee to explore the option of internalisation”, and “not for the immediate implementation of internalisation”.

“Removing the manager now will cause significant unitholder value destruction and appointing a replacement is estimated to take more than one year, with unitholders bearing the costs,” it said.

The EGM date has been changed. It will now be held at 10am on Aug 7.

Units of Sabana Reit closed at S$0.43 on Tuesday, before a trading halt was called on Wednesday."
2023-07-26,Parkway Life Reit posts 3.3% rise in H1 DPU to S$0.0729,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/parkway-life-reit-posts-33-rise-h1-dpu-s00729,"PARKWAY : C2PU +0.27% Life Real Estate Investment Trust : C2PU +0.27%’s (Parkway Life Reit) distribution per unit (DPU) rose by 3.3 per cent to S$0.0729 for its first half ended Jun 30, 2023, from S$0.0706 previous corresponding period.

On an annualised basis, H1 DPU was S$0.1458, up 3.3 per cent from S$0.1412 in the same period a year earlier, it stated in results released on Wednesday (Jul 26).

The rise in distributions came as gross revenue grew 23.6 per cent to S$74.4 million from S$60.2 million.
This was mainly due to contributions from five Japanese nursing homes acquired in September 2022, along with higher rent from the Reit’s Singapore properties, partially offset by a depreciation in the yen.
Net property income was 25.1 per cent higher at S$70.1 million from S$56 million in the previous corresponding period, while distributable income grew by 3.3 per cent on the year to S$44.1 million from S$42.7 million.
The distribution will be paid out on Aug 30, after book closure on Aug 3.
The manager said the Reit realised around S$3.3 million in foreign exchange gains from the settlement of Japanese yen forward contracts in H1 2023, compared with the S$1.9 million realised in H1 2022. These partially offset higher management fees.

Finance costs also rose on the funding of capital expenditure and 2022 acquisitions. Higher interest costs from Singapore-dollar debts, however, were partially offset by the depreciation of the Japanese yen.

The Reit’s aggregate leverage stood at 35.3 per cent as at Jun 30, 2023, down from 36.4 per cent in the same period last year. This implies a debt headroom of between S$404.3 million and S$673.6 million.

Its weighted average lease expiry by gross revenue stands at around 16.7 years.

Yong Yean Chau, chief executive of the manager, said the Reit’s assets are well-placed to benefit from the growth of the healthcare industry in Asia-Pacific.

“The healthcare industry will remain critically essential in a rapidly ageing population with greater demand for better quality healthcare and aged care services,” he noted.

Units of Parkway Life Reit closed 0.8 per cent or S$0.03 higher at S$3.85 on Tuesday."
2023-07-28,Procedures to internalise Sabana Reit’s manager are in place: Quarz Capital,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/procedures-internalise-sabana-reits-manager-are-place-quarz-capital,"THERE are strong legal and regulatory frameworks in Singapore to safeguard unitholders of a real estate investment trust (Reit) during the process of setting up a new internal manager, said activist investor Quarz Capital.

It also said that there will be no vacancy in the management of Sabana Industrial Reit : M1GU 0%, if unitholders vote to replace its current external manager with an internal one.

The Reit’s trustee “has confirmed that it will only remove the external manager once the internal manager is fully set up, licensed and ready to take over”, Quarz added.


Quarz, which also holds units of Sabana Reit, made these arguments in an open letter to the Reit’s unitholders, management and board on Thursday (Jul 27). It sought to refute claims made by the current manager Sabana Real Estate Investment Management (SREIM), as well as its owner ESR Group, that there are hurdles to internalisation given that no blueprint currently exists for such a structure.

In the letter, Quarz said that legal and regulatory action might be taken against SREIM and its directors if it fails to fulfil its obligations.

“The Monetary Authority of Singapore has specifically put in place a comprehensive regulatory framework to ensure stability, continuity, and protection to safeguard unitholders in the removal of manager and internalisation process,” it noted.
Quarz and ESR Group, along with SREIM, have been embroiled in a fiery exchange over the past two months, after the activist investor requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to vote on two resolutions.

The first resolution is to remove SREIM as the Reit’s current manager. The second resolution, if passed, will put into action the internalisation of Sabana Reit’s management by incorporating a subsidiary wholly owned by the Reit’s trustee and appointing such a subsidiary to act as the Reit’s manager.

The EGM, which was originally slated to be held on Aug 4, will now be held on Aug 7.

ESR Group has made the case to unitholders that the passing of the second resolution would not automatically lead to internalisation. On the contrary, it said that the resolution’s passage would cast Sabana Reit into a prolonged period of uncertainty, which could result in a loss of confidence in the Reit. 

This is because the lack of an internalised management structure for Reits means considerable time and costs will be needed to identify and establish one before getting it approved by unitholders.

ESR Group also previously said that there is “no assurance or certainty” that existing staff of SREIM would be willing to stay on if both resolutions are passed.

In its latest salvo, Quarz said that claims made by SREIM and ESR Group are “scare tactics” and “empty threats”.

Besides its argument that procedures for internalisation are already in place, Quarz also said it will likely take less than two years of cost savings to fully pay for the projected cost of setting up the new internal manager. This is estimated to be between S$3 million and S$5 million.

“However, the true cost savings for unitholders is the complete alignment of interest of the internal manager,” Quarz said. “This ensures that no unitholders’ monies will be wasted in potentially value-destructive acquisitions done to boost acquisition, performance and management fees to the external manager.”

Units of Sabana Reit fell 1.2 per cent or S$0.005 to close at S$0.41 on Thursday, before the open letter was posted on the bourse."

Vincent Yeo, chief executive of CDLHT’s managers, said strong leisure travel and the resumption of events have been key growth drivers across most geographical markets.

CDLHT’s revenue was up 20.9 per cent to S$119.2 million for the half-year period, from S$98.6 million in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, net property income grew 23.3 per cent year on year to S$62.9 million from S$51 million.
That brings the total income available for distribution, after retention for working capital, to S$31.2 million. This is 23.8 per cent higher than the S$25.2 million recorded in the same period last year.
The distribution will be paid out on Aug 29, after the CDLHT’s books are closed on Aug 7.
Revenue per available room (RevPAR) grew across most of CDLHT’s markets. Its Singapore properties booked a 45.8 per cent rise year on year in RevPAR to S$182, surpassing pre-pandemic levels.
“Notably, 12 of our portfolio hotels have seen RevPAR in H1 2023 exceeding H1 2019 pre-pandemic levels, even though Chinese tourists have yet to return in full,” Yeo said.

The managers noted that overall performance “would have been much stronger” if Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel did not close its entire conference facilities for renovation from April to June this year.

The stapled group had also progressively removed close to 34,000 room nights from inventory for ongoing refurbishment works in H1 2023.

CDLHT’s gearing stood at 37.9 per cent as at Jun 30, implying debt headroom of about S$715.3 million, assuming a gearing limit of 50 per cent.

It also has S$63.8 million in cash reserves and S$585.2 million in credit facilities, the managers said.

The stapled group consists of CDL Hospitality Reit and CDL Hospitality Business Trust. Its counter closed 0.8 per cent or S$0.01 lower at S$1.18 on Friday."
2023-07-28,CapitaLand Ascott Trust’s manager eyes stronger second half amid travel recovery,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/capitaland-ascott-trusts-manager-eyes-stronger-second-half-amid,"THE manager of CapitaLand Ascott Trust (Clas) sees upside for its portfolio in the second half, after delivering a “strong” set of results in the first half ended Jun 30.

Serena Teo, chief executive of the manager, said at a results briefing on Friday (Jul 28) that indicators for the second half look positive on a sequential basis, and when considered against H2 2022.

“Demand for accommodation from various leading indicators, as well as what we see, continues to be strong,” she said. “We expect upside in the second half, whether it’s from seasonal demand, (or) contributions from new assets.”
Clas reported on Thursday that distribution per stapled security (DPS) rose 19 per cent year on year in the first half to S$0.0278.

This came on the back of a 30 per cent improvement in revenue, mainly due to strong operating performance of Clas properties as travel continued to pick up pace.

Portfolio revenue per available unit (RevPAU) grew 20 per cent year on year to S$149 in Q2 2023, around 98 per cent of pre-Covid levels. Teo said this was largely due to higher average daily rates (ADRs), which have already surpassed pre-pandemic levels in many key markets.
While there are market concerns over macroeconomic uncertainties, she said she is optimistic Clas will be able to sustain the room rates, as it has not seen any pressure coming from corporate budget cuts so far.

“Given the location strength, as well as the property strength, we’ve actually not seen any pressure in terms of the ability to increase room rates,” she said, and added that rates have continued rising for forward bookings.

She pointed out, however, that occupancy still has “room for improvement”. Clas’ portfolio occupancy in the first half stood at about 75 per cent – around 90 per cent of what it used to be before Covid-19.

Teo noted that most in the hospitality industry expect the second half to be seasonally stronger than the first half.

Key factors for the optimism include the summer travel season, increased flight capacities and the resumption of events. The Singapore properties could also clock strong performances in the third quarter, with the Formula 1 night race being held in the city-state in September.

Apart from seasonal trends, contribution from new assets that were acquired or have undergone asset-enhancement initiatives could also boosted performance.

Teo added that the trust’s portfolio also has both stable and growth components. Around 20 per cent of gross profit comes from longer-stay assets such as rental housing and student accommodation. The remainder of the portfolio is split between master leases, management contracts and management contracts with minimum guaranteed income.

In terms of acquisitions, Teo said that the manager would consider opportunities presented by well-located properties in places with sustained travel demand.

“We would be looking for accretive acquisitions across all asset segments… preferably with a possibility of further uplift through value-add,” she said, adding that it would consider both sponsor and third-party sources.

The trust is divesting four mature properties in France for 44.4 million euros (S$63.4 million), in line with its portfolio reconstitution efforts. The proceeds could potentially be recycled into higher-yielding investments.

Clas had a gearing of 38.6 per cent as at Jun 30, with 80 per cent of its debt on fixed rates. Its effective borrowing cost remained at 2.3 per cent per annum.

CGS-CIMB analysts Natalie Ong and Lock Mun Yee noted on Friday that the first-half distributions for Clas were in line with its forecasts. They kept the brokerage’s “add” rating, with an unchanged target price of S$1.27.

“Clas’ diversified and balanced portfolio provides both stability and upside exposure to the hospitality sector, as well as portfolio reconstitution opportunities,” they said.

Other hospitality trusts in Singapore also reported higher H1 earnings on Friday, in line with CGS-CIMB forecasts.

CDL Hospitality Trusts reported that H1 DPS rose 23 per cent on year to S$0.0251. Similarly, Far East Hospitality Trust said its DPS for the first half was up 24.7 per cent to S$0.0192.

This comes as the total amount available for distribution declined by 1 per cent to S$327.5 million, which was attributed to higher interest expense resulting from rising interest rates. DPU was also lower due to an enlarged unit base following the real estate investment trust’s (Reit) private placement in May.

Revenue for the period climbed 7.7 per cent to S$718.1 million, from S$666.5 million, due to the acquisition of seven logistics properties in Chicago in June last year, the acquisition of three Singapore properties in the first half of 2023, as well as the completed acquisitions of two properties in Australia in February 2022.
Higher utilities income and an increase in service charge earned from the Singapore properties also contributed to this jump. 

Net property income rose 6.7 per cent to S$508.8 million, from S$476.9 million. 

Property operating expenses grew to S$209.3 million from S$189.6 million, which the Reit manager noted was due to completed acquisitions in FY2022 and the first half of FY2023 as well as higher utility costs incurred in Singapore. 
The Reit’s portfolio occupancy was stable at 94.4 per cent as at June 2023, slightly above the 94 per cent occupancy a year earlier.

Markets in Singapore, Australia, United Kingdom and Europe recorded improved occupancies over the past year, but occupancy in the US dipped to 92.1 per cent from 95.3 per cent a year earlier.

Clar achieved an average rental reversion of 18 per cent for its portfolio for leases renewed in Q2 2023. The manager is guiding for “positive high single digit” growth for the full year.

The Singapore logistics segment led the increase in rents, with a 39.1 per cent reversion.

William Tay, chief executive of the manager, said in the earnings call that there is still a supply and demand imbalance for logistics properties with “hardly any supply” currently. He noted that companies have been shifting from “just in time” to “just in case” operations management, which has driven demand.

Tay said the manager will continue to be cautious and leverage its balance sheet, operational capabilities and diversified portfolio to safeguard and expand its business.

He noted that market expectations are for more transactions to take place in the second half, as interest rates are likely close to their peak.

“We do see more interest to transact,” he said, adding that the manager has also been quite active. The Reit has around S$1 billion of debt headroom before aggregate leverage hits 40 per cent, and Tay said they would be able to use this when an opportunity arises.

Tay added that the Reit is on track for a potential acquisition in Europe that was previously announced. Due diligence has been completed and details are being finalised, he said.

As at Jun 30, Clar’s aggregate leverage stood at 36.7 per cent, with a weighted average all-in cost of borrowing of 3.3 per cent. Some 82 per cent of its borrowings are on fixed rates.

Clar has S$668 million of debt that is due to be refinanced in FY23. The average cost of these borrowings is currently around 2 per cent. A 100 basis point increase in interest rate on refinancing is expected to have a pro forma impact of S$6.7 million decline in distribution or 0.16 cents decline in DPU.

Clar said its portfolio valuation remained stable as at Jun 30, with its 230 investment properties worth S$17 billion.

Apart from acquisitions, the manager would also consider opportunities to redevelop existing properties, if there are opportunities to unlock plot ratio or increase rentals.

Clar said on Monday it will be redeveloping an industrial property at 5 Toh Guan Road East, for an estimated total cost of S$107.4 million. The redevelopment, which is expected to be completed by end-2025, would increase gross floor area by 71 per cent.

“I think in Singapore, there’s still more opportunity for us to redevelop,” Tay said. “We believe that the location that we are sitting on is a very good location, and if we can find the right usage to be able to get a higher rental, that will help us to reposition our assets.”

Units of Clar fell 1.4 per cent or S$0.04 to close at S$2.81 on Monday, before the announcement."
2023-08-02,"Sias questions ESR Group, Quarz Capital on internalisation of Sabana Reit’s manager",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/sias-questions-esr-group-quarz-capital-internalisation-sabana-reits-manager,"THE Securities Investors Association (Singapore) or Sias is seeking further clarification on unitholders’ behalf from ESR Group and Quarz Capital about the internalisation of the management function of Sabana Industrial Real Estate Investment Trust : M1GU 0% (Reit).

The matter would be put to a unitholder vote on Aug 7, in an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) requisitioned by activist investor Quarz Capital.

In an e-mail on Wednesday (Aug 2), Sias asked ESR Group, the Reit’s sponsor, how it would respond to unitholders who believe ESR Group has an interest in maintaining the “status quo” and ensuring Sabana Reit does not become a competitor to ESR-Logos, another Reit sponsored by the group.
It also asked ESR Group why it does not support the internalisation of the Reit manager, Sabana Real Estate Investment Management (SREIM), as the sponsor does not appear to actively contribute to Sabana Reit’s growth.
“This move would eliminate any operational and governance constraints,” said Sias.
It noted that establishing an internal manager to drive the Reit’s growth would also benefit all shareholders, “especially minority shareholders who find themselves caught between the clash of substantial unitholders”.
In addition, Sias requested the group to outline how it might have directly or indirectly helped Sabana Reit lower its costs.

The association questioned whether ESR Group had contacted Sabana Reit’s borrowers to confirm if borrowing costs would be increased and existing interest rate hedges unwound, should the manager be removed. 

ESR Group was also asked to confirm that it would not “take any active steps to undermine Sabana Reit if unitholders voted for the internalisation”. 

Separately, Sias queried Quarz, which is pushing for the internalisation of SREIM, on whether it would be willing to provide financial support to Sabana Reit if the manager is internalised. 

Quarz has “repeatedly pledged its support to help the trustee effect the implementation of internalisation”, noted Sias.

It asked if Quarz had been engaged by the trustee of Sabana Reit since it requisitioned the EGM, to be held on Aug 7, or whether it has, in turn, engaged with the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Singapore Exchange Regulation. 

Quarz should also explain why unitholders should not be concerned about Sabana Reit having an estimated S$300 million in unsecured loans, despite Ernst & Young highlighting it as a material uncertainty, said Sias. 

Sias also asked if Quarz had considered the risks and potential impact of SREIM failing to fulfil their obligations, in the event unitholders voted to remove them. 

The association questioned Quarz’s confidence that an internal manager would be value-accretive for unitholders, particularly as Singapore law requires a Reit to have a board of directors and chief executive officer. 

Internalisation of a Reit manager is “neither tested nor proven in Singapore”, the association noted. 

Sias therefore requested Quarz to outline areas where it can help to “add value and expedite the internalisation process”.

Both parties were asked to respond by Aug 3.

Also on Wednesday, HSBC Institutional Trust Services, the trustee of Sabana Reit, sent a letter to SREIM reiterating its stance. It also stated that unitholders should read its statement in full “when referring to any market commentary”.

Meanwhile, ESR Group on Wednesday sent another letter to the Reit’s unitholders, urging them to “vote for stability and allow the manager to focus on delivering returns”.

It highlighted that independent proxy advisor Glass Lewis had recommended unitholders vote against the resolutions to remove SREIM and internalise the management function of Sabana Reit.

ESR Group said it was “now clear” that removing SREIM would not result in the cost savings outlined by Quarz.

Should the resolutions pass, unitholders would still have to pay ongoing management fees to the interim manager until a replacement can be appointed, it added.

Units of Sabana Reit closed flat at S$0.41 on Wednesday."
2023-08-06,Institutional investors net buyers of these 10 S-Reits in July,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/institutional-investors-net-buyers-these-10-s-reits-july,"The 10 S-Reits and property trusts recorded combined net institutional inflows of over S$38.2 million.

Keppel DC Reit in its H1 2023 results announced distributable income (DI) of S$91.3 million, which was 0.2 per cent higher year on year. The growth in DI was due mainly to contributions from the accretive acquisitions of Guangdong Data Centre 2 and the building shell of Guangdong Data Centre 3; reversions from contract renewals and escalations; and tax savings. Keppel DC Reit declared a distribution per unit (DPU) of 5.051 Singapore cents for H1 2023, and its portfolio occupancy remains at 98.5 per cent. In H1 2023, the manager also secured new, renewal and expansion data centre contracts in Singapore, Ireland, and the Netherlands with overall positive reversions. Keppel DC Reit was the fourth-best performing S-Reit in the month of July, with 3.7 per cent total returns.

CICT was the best-performing S-Reit in July, generating 6.8 per cent in total returns. CICT reported a distributable income of S$353.2 million for H1 2023, an increase of 1.7 per cent year on year, and driven by acquisitions of CapitaSky and its Australia portfolio as well as its completed asset enhancement of Raffles City Singapore. CICT’s H1 2023 DPU was 5.3 Singapore cents, up 1.5 per cent year on year. CICT’s committed portfolio occupancy improved to 96.7 per cent, up 0.5 percentage points from Mar 31, 2023.
Clint reported that its H1 FY2023 total property income and net property income grew 7 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively, year-on-year, mainly due to higher portfolio occupancy which improved from 92 per cent from the start of the year to 94 per cent, as at Jun 30, 2023. Clint’s DPU for H1 FY2023 was 3.36 Singapore cents, lower year-on-year due to an enlarged unit base after its preferential offering in July 2023. Its portfolio leasable area has grown by 24 per cent since the start of the year, with the addition of Block A in International Tech Park Hyderabad and the acquisition of International Tech Park Pune, Hinjawadi"
2023-08-07,"Sabana Reit unitholders approve removal of manager, with 57.5% of vote in favour",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/sabana-reit-unitholders-approve-removal-manager-575-vote-favour,"UNITHOLDERS of Sabana Industrial Real Estate Investment Trust : M1GU 0% (Sabana Reit) voted to remove Sabana Real Estate Investment Management (SREIM) and kick off the process of internalising the Reit’s manager.

At an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on Monday (Aug 7), unitholders voted on two resolutions. The first was to remove SREIM as the Reit’s manager as soon as practicable. Out of 691 million votes cast, 57.5 per cent were in favour of the resolution. The Reit has nearly 1.1 billion units in issue.

The second resolution was to effect the internalisation of the Reit management function by incorporating a subsidiary wholly owned by the trustee, and appointing it to act as Sabana Reit’s manager. For this resolution, 55.6 per cent were in favour.
Their decision is a landmark for the Singapore Reit market, which has never seen an internally managed Reit. Netlink NBN Trust : CJLU -0.58%, which is internally managed, is a business trust.

The EGM had been requisitioned in June by activist investor Quarz Capital, which has a 14 per cent interest in the Reit.

Hong Kong-listed ESR Group, which owns SREIM and has a 20.6 per cent interest in Sabana Reit, had been against the internalisation.
At the EGM, SREIM had reiterated points previously made: That the removal of an external Reit manager and internalisation of the management function was unprecedented in Singapore, and that the Reit’s trustee had said such a move could take at least 12 months or longer to complete.

After the manager’s presentation, Quarz encouraged unitholders to vote in favour of the resolutions and reminded them that SREIM had also previously recommended unitholders give the green light for a merger of Sabana Reit with ESR-Reit (now ESR-Logos Reit) at an unfavourable price.

After the results were announced to some cheers from investors, Quarz urged staff of SREIM to stay on and join the internalised management team.

Several investors present at the EGM told The Business Times they believed that an internalised manager would be cheaper and thus boost distributions per unit.

“Although there will be a turbulent (period) this year or so, we can overcome it. We have gone through a lot of troubled waters in Sabana Reit,” said one investor who has been a Sabana Reit unitholder since its 2010 initial public offering.

Some investors also pointed to the example of Croesus Retail Trust, a retail business trust that internalised its manager in 2016, as an example of an internally managed trust that gave good returns to its unitholders. Croesus was delisted in 2017 when it was acquired by US private equity giant Blackstone.

They were also hopeful the current management team would continue to work with Sabana Reit. One investor, Louis Lee, said SREIM’s management had done a reasonable job and there should be no reason for them to fear losing their jobs.

“It’s most heartening to know that (Quarz) extended the olive branch to all those people who want to stay behind and contribute to the better success of Sabana Reit,” he added.

Another retail investor, who gave his name as Benjy, suggested that the Reit could also take the opportunity to buy SREIM “at an acceptable price”. This would smooth the transition, he said.

“Internalising is definitely a plus. Every unitholder will gain. The devil is in the details (of the) implementation,” he added.

In a statement following the EGM, Donald Han, chief executive of SREIM, said Sabana Reit proved “small but significant” with its “landmark EGM outcome”.

“The Reit will now commence the internalisation process and re-define the S-Reit landscape,” he said.

Tan Cheong Hin, chairman of SREIM’s board of directors, said the manager respects the removal decision. Both Tan and Han thanked members of SREIM’s management team and board.

ESR Group said in a statement it was disappointed that the resolutions were passed. It now expects the Reit trustee to appoint appropriate advisers and come up with a plan to safeguard the interests of all unitholders.

Quarz, in its statement, said it is “highly confident that Sabana’s bankers will support the more than 10,000 unitholders, many of whom are Singaporeans and also their customers”.

The trustee of Sabana Reit had on Jun 30 entered into a facility agreement with UOB for up to S$100 million in sustainability-linked term and revolving facilities. The facility agreement had contained provisions relating to ESR’s shareholding and places restrictions on any change of the manager or property manager of the Reit.

A UOB spokesperson declined to comment.

2023-08-08,Brokers’ take: DBS downgrades Sabana Reit to ‘fully valued’ on near-term uncertainties,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/brokers-take-dbs-downgrades-sabana-reit-fully-valued-near-term-uncertainties,"THE upcoming internalisation of Sabana Industrial Real Estate Investment Trust : M1GU 0%’s (Sabana Reit) management could signal potential overheads that could impact overall returns, according to DBS Group Research.

On Tuesday (Aug 8), the research house downgraded its call on Sabana Reit to “fully valued” from “hold”, while reducing its price target to S$0.30 from S$0.48.

The downgrade came after an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on Monday, where unitholders of Sabana Reit voted to remove Sabana Real Estate Investment Management and kick off the process of internalising the Reit’s manager.


The research house expects Sabana Reit’s performance as Singapore’s first internalised Reit manager to “create additional uncertainties”, at least in the short term. 

“While cost rationalisation and a more aligned management team with unitholders’ interest are mooted benefits, we believe that this is likely felt in the medium term. The current transactional phase could mean additional costs and resources which could add pressure to the returns of the Reit,” said DBS’ analysts. 

This has led to the analysts raising their cost of equity assumptions, resulting in the lower target price. 
Moreover, while forward yields remain attractive at 7.3 per cent for the Reit, the analysts remain cognisant of potential cost spikes, along with uncertainties around the Reit’s refinancing.

According to their calculations, every 100 basis-point increase in borrowing costs will lead to a 9.2 per cent decrease in distribution per unit (DPU), which will result in the DPU yield falling to 6.6 per cent from the current estimation of 7.3 per cent. 

“Although it is uncertain if there will be any impact to borrowing costs in the immediate term, we believe that, given the Reit’s internalised status, lenders may relook credit spreads when loans come due for refinancing,” they noted. 

DBS envisioned further EGMs and administrative procedures to be carried out in the coming months, leading to additional costs and even greater pressure on the Reit’s returns. 

“The process of internalising and searching for replacement management candidates could be a long drawn-out process that also comes with additional costs and resources, potentially eroding any expected cost savings, at least in the near to medium term.”  

Units of the Reit closed flat at S$0.405 on Aug 4 before the Reit’s manager called for a trading halt on the morning of Aug 7."
2023-08-21,"Reits, business trusts should avoid raising new equity to fund acquisitions",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/reits-business-trusts-should-avoid-raising-new-equity-fund-acquisitions,"PUBLIC-LISTED entities face onerous disclosure and compliance requirements. But a listed entity can fairly easily issue securities to raise funds.

Many property development and investment companies hardly make use of their listed status to raise equity in the secondary market.

Some listed property-related trusts, on the other hand, tap the equities market periodically to raise funds.
Many listed real estate investment trusts (Reits) and business trusts are hungry to grow their asset size via new acquisitions. But as these trusts generally distribute most taxable income, they may have little retained earnings to fund new property purchases.

Said trusts would need to raise debt or equity funding. While borrowing more can be considered, trust managers may be keen to maintain a conservative gearing level, and debt is costly when interest rates are high.

Invariably, some trusts issue new equity to help fund acquisitions. 
However, raising equity is tricky in a high interest rate environment. Some trusts may issue new equity at below book value. Prices of trusts often react negatively to news of equity fund-raising exercises.

Add to that the fact that many investors who participated in equity fund-raising exercises by listed trusts may not be making any capital gains, and it’s little wonder that the market doesn’t take well to an equity raise.

In early June, Mapletree Industrial Trust : ME8U +1.38% (MIT) completed a private placement of 92.6 million new units that raised around S$205 million. Funds raised are largely for use in the partial funding of the purchase of a data centre in Osaka, Japan, which is expected to boost net asset value and distribution per unit (DPU).

MIT is a constituent of the benchmark Straits Times Index and has a solid track record, as well as a strong sponsor in Temasek’s Mapletree Investments.

Under the placement, new units were issued at a discount to the then prevailing market price. Investors took up new MIT units at S$2.212. The trust’s unit price closed at S$2.20 on Aug 21. 

For the latest quarter ended June, MIT’s DPU rose quarter on quarter but fell year on year. The trust enjoyed positive rental revisions across most property segments.

CapitaLand Ascott Trust
In the latest round of results announcements, some hospitality trusts shone. Helped by robust growth in lodging demand, CapitaLand Ascott Trust : HMN +1.13% (Clas) posted a 19 per cent year on year rise in distribution per stapled security (DPS) for H1.

Prospects for Clas, which focuses on serviced residences, rental housing properties, student accommodation and other hospitality assets, look rosy. In its latest results presentation, Clas’ managers said the trust is poised for continued growth and that notwithstanding macroeconomic uncertainties, the demand for accommodation remains robust.

However, Clas’ latest raising of equity funding is hurting investors who held stapled securities of Clas prior to the fund-raising, including myself. 

On Aug 2, Clas announced the launch of an equity fund-raising to raise at least S$300 million in gross proceeds through a private placement and a preferential offering of new stapled securities. 

Funds raised are to be largely used to partially fund the proposed purchase of three assets for an agreed property value of S$530.8 million: The Cavendish London hotel in the UK, the Temple Bar Hotel in Dublin, Ireland, and the Ascott Kuningan Jakarta serviced residence in Indonesia, as well as to help fund proposed asset enhancement initiatives at Novotel Sydney Central, Australia and Citadines Holborn-Covent Garden London.


The private placement was completed, with new stapled securities issued on Aug 14 at S$1.043 apiece. The preferential offering is open for acceptance between Aug 16 and Aug 24. In the preferential offering, eligible investors can get 29 new stapled securities for every 1,000 existing stapled securities at S$1.025 per new stapled security.
Investors who held Clas’ stapled securities prior to the launch of the equity fund-raising exercise are not sitting pretty. 

Take an investor who held 10,000 units of Clas. Prior to the launch of the equity fund-raising exercise, Clas traded at S$1.12 per stapled security. As at Aug 21, Clas traded at S$1.01 per stapled security. 

Said investor can receive a DPS of S$0.02778 for H1 2023 and around S$0.00694 for the period Jul 1 to Aug 13. After including the receipt of the above distributions, said investor is worse off by about S$750. 

Should the investor participate in the preferential offering, he could be looking at a loss as the issue price of the new stapled securities exceeds Clas’ last traded price on Aug 21.

The proposed purchase of the three assets by Clas from The Ascott Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Clas’ sponsor CapitaLand Investment : 9CI +1.97% (CLI), might boost Clas’ DPS. But any marginal future uplift to Clas’ DPS may not be worth the pain for investors who have seen Clas’ stapled security price fall post the announcement of the equity fund-raising exercise.
As a major shareholder of Clas, CLI suffers when Clas’ stapled security price falls. But, CLI can draw comfort that it is making progress on asset divestments by selling the three assets. Also, CLI owns the managers of Clas, who will collect an acquisition fee payable in stapled securities of Clas of approximately S$5.3 million. Moreover, the managers of Clas can see their management fees grow as the trust scales up.

Recently, unitholders of Sabana Industrial Reit : M1GU 0% voted to internalise the management of the Reit. Sponsors, including CLI and Mapletree, and external managers of listed trusts should be mindful that more investors may push for internal management arrangements, where trust investors own the manager, in efforts to achieve cost savings. External managers of listed trusts must up the ante to show that they add value to investors.

The equities market is jittery. Managers of Reits and business trusts should focus on selling assets first and recycling capital raised to fund new property buys, without tapping equity investors for funding.

Singapore’s listed trust sector has come far over the past two decades. Let’s not lose investors’ faith in the sector because of corporate actions which potentially harm investors and change these trusts from being boring, defensive investment instruments."
2023-08-22,Is the worst over for Singapore Reits?,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/worst-over-singapore-reits,"OVER the past year, Singapore Reits (S-Reits) have significantly underperformed the Straits Times Index (STI).

S-Reits recorded a negative total return of -12 per cent during the period, trailing the STI’s positive returns of 2 per cent as at Aug 18, 2023.

The S-Reit earnings season recently concluded. Many S-Reits reported disappointing results for the first half of the year. Only hospitality S-Reits achieved positive distribution per unit (DPU) growth year on year on average, helped by an ongoing travel recovery.
Meanwhile, all other sectors delivered an average growth rate in the negative territory, mainly attributed to higher interest expense due to rising interest rates.

Impact of China’s slowdown
Among hospitality Reits, Far East Hospitality Trust, in particular, posted strong performance with a DPU growth of 24.7 per cent year on year in H1. Driven by healthy tourist arrivals into Singapore and good demand from corporate groups, gross revenue from the hotel and serviced residence segments recovered above pre-Covid levels in 2019.

Looking ahead, a healthy pipeline of events such as the upcoming Formula 1 in September, concerts and receipts from the meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions sector are anticipated to continue to attract an influx of tourists to Singapore.
But the next phase of the hospitality recovery largely rests on Chinese tourists, historically the top tourism source for Singapore. Tourist arrivals from China have yet to pick up pace. Indonesian tourists outnumbered Chinese tourists in July, said the Singapore Tourism Board.

In our view, China’s lacklustre economic growth and a weakening RMB against SGD may cause potential Chinese tourists to tighten their belts. Longer-term structural shifts also exist, and the Chinese are beginning to travel more domestically. The Chinese government has supported this shift, rolling out efforts to position Hainan as a top sight-seeing and domestic destination for domestic tourists.

Interest rates a challenge for industrial Reits
Industrial Reits also delivered a relatively resilient performance compared to the overall S-Reit sector.

The largest industrial Reit – CapitaLand Ascendas Reit – achieved improved portfolio occupancy, positive double-digit rental reversions, and contributions from acquisitions. However, DPU still fell by 2 per cent year on year in H1, as the increase in net property income was more than offset by the rise in borrowing costs.

We note that the strong rental reversion was largely led by the Singapore logistics segment. Besides limited supply, third-party logistics companies continue to drive demand for ramp-up logistics assets in the Republic.

Over the long term, we believe that elevated e-commerce penetration and supply-chain diversification should sustain demand and provide resilience for industrial Reits focused on logistics properties. Nonetheless, the high-interest-rate environment remains a key near-term challenge, and several Reits continue to sound caution on higher borrowing costs weighing on DPU growth. While an end to the Fed’s rate-hike cycle may be approaching, we expect policymakers to hold rates higher for longer due to persistent inflation and a stronger-than-expected US economy.

US office S-Reits under pressure
On a less positive note, another sector that caught our attention are the US office S-Reits. The trio of US office S-Reits – Manulife US Reit, Prime US Reit and Keppel Pacific Oak US Reit – reported significant falls in their DPUs in H1. They also saw large share price declines of between 50 per cent and 80 per cent within a year, reflecting the depressed investor sentiment.

Manulife US Reit made headlines when substantial falls in property valuations pushed its aggregate leverage to 56.7 per cent as at Jun 30, way above the regulatory limit of 50 per cent. Moreover, distributions to unitholders were halted for H1, reflecting the immense challenges the Reit is facing.

Looking ahead, we believe the risk of further downward revaluations remains, given elevated office vacancy rates and high interest rates. It may also need to conduct equity fundraising to raise capital and pull its leverage back to a more desirable level. In addition, its bottom line remains challenged by high borrowing costs and a deteriorating US office market.

Meanwhile, its peers also grapple with challenges. At present, Prime US Reit’s leverage is high, at 42.8 per cent. We think that the portfolio valuation could decline further by 10 per cent by end-2023. This would take its leverage to about 47 per cent, just a hair’s breadth below the regulatory limit, providing little buffer against potential changes in market conditions.

Lastly, we think Keppel Pacific Oak US Reit appears to be in a better position to navigate the challenges in the US office market. This is underpinned by its focus on growth markets, which benefit from the migration of businesses drawn by lower taxes and more business-friendly government policies. Furthermore, its leverage stands at a healthy 38.2 per cent, providing greater buffer against a decline in property valuations.

Nonetheless, we are monitoring potential catalysts that could drive a re-rating, such as the stabilisation of the portfolio and better-than-expected earnings in future quarters.

Remain selective
On the whole, the yield spread between the S-Reit sector and the Singapore 10-year government bond remains at a multi-year low, suggesting that the risk-reward proposition is unattractive.

We believe balance sheet strength ought to be a key differentiator when investing in S-Reits, avoiding those with high gearing ratios. Security selection can also be made on a sectoral level.

Amid economic headwinds, S-Reits that benefit from strong secular demand such as industrial Reits should stay relatively resilient. Meanwhile, we reckon investors should avoid buying the dip in US office S-Reits due to a lack of catalysts to drive a robust and sustainable recovery.

Investors who find security selection to be overwhelming may consider a Reit ETF. Viable options include the NikkoAM-StraitsTrading Asia ex-Japan Reit ETF or the Lion-Phillip S-Reit ETF. The latter has no exposure to US office S-Reits."
2023-08-23,More than two-thirds of S-Reits report DPU decline in H1; analysts see tougher H2,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/reits-property/more-two-thirds-s-reits-report-dpu-decline-h1-analysts-see-tougher,"HIGHER financing costs continued to wreak havoc on Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) in the first half of 2023. Market watchers believe the worst is yet to be.

Of the 37 S-Reits and property trusts that reported distribution per unit (DPU) figures for the period ended June, only 11 managed to eke out a year-on-year improvement.

The remaining 26 posted declines in DPU. Three Reits – Dasin Retail Trust : CEDU -10.53%, Lippo Malls Indonesia Retail Trust : D5IU +5.88%, and Manulife US Reit : BTOU +4% – stopped distributions in the latest period.

Gabriel Yap, a veteran Reits investor and chairman of GCP Global, noted that some Reits made acquisitions and completed asset-enhancement initiatives that boosted revenue and net property income (NPI).

“But at the bottom line – the DPU, which is most critical for investors and the share price – they failed to deliver,” he said.

Looking just at toplines, though, most of the S-Reits did not fare badly.

Out of the 37 S-Reits that posted revenue figures for the period ended June, 26 saw an improvement from the same period in the year before. And 24 of the S-Reits logged a year-on-year increase in NPI.

“Our biggest positive takeaway would be the operational performance of Singapore assets,” RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan said.

“Robust operational numbers were seen across all asset classes in Singapore, with occupancy and rental growth slightly exceeding expectations. This has resulted in largely stable valuations,” he added.

Maybank analyst Krishna Guha highlighted several other key operational metrics that were in good shape: “(Rental) reversions continue to stay positive, with strong numbers reported by some of the industrial Reits.

“Committed occupancy also continues to be high across listed Reits under various subsectors, especially in Singapore.”

Distributions were largely impacted by higher financing costs. Most of the S-Reits with overseas-based assets also suffered from foreign currency exchange losses.

“The biggest setback came from the depreciation of the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Chinese yuan, which affected results from S-Reits with a sizeable portion of their portfolio overseas,” said UOB Kay Hian analyst Jonathan Koh.

The troubled trio that have halted distribution payments are all foreign-based S-Reits.

“Manulife’s huge revaluation losses caught many investors by surprise,” added Koh. The US office S-Reit halted distribution for the first half ended Jun 30, after breaching the unencumbered gearing ratio laid out in financial covenants with banks. This caused all its loans to be reclassified as current liabilities.

Other overseas players that were among the big losers were BHG Retail Reit : BMGU 0%, which saw its DPU tumble 53.9 per cent for H1, as well as Prime US Reit : OXMU 0%, EC World Reit : BWCU 0%, Elite Commercial Reit : MXNU -2.04%, IReit Global : UD1U +1.39% and CapitaLand India Trust : CY6U -0.96%, which logged DPU declines of between 21.5 per cent and 30.1 per cent.

By subsector, office Reits were a particularly weak link in H1. Most clocked double-digit declines in DPU.

The relative outperformer was Keppel Reit : K71U +1.2%, which reported a 2.4 per cent drop in DPU on higher property expenses and borrowing costs.

On the other end of the spectrum was the hospitality Reits subsector.

All four hospitality S-Reits that reported their H1 results – Far East Hospitality Trust : Q5T +0.85%, CDL Hospitality Trusts : J85 -0.99%, CapitaLand Ascott Trust : HMN +1.13% and ARA US Hospitality Trust : XZL +3.85% – recorded year-on-year improvements across the board on the revenue, NPI, distributable income and DPU fronts.

Frasers Hospitality Trust : ACV 0% did not disclose its financial figures for its third quarter ended June.

ARA US Hospitality Trust posted a 5.2 per cent increase in DPU for H1, while the other three hospitality S-Reits saw DPU growth of between 19.3 per cent and 24.7 per cent.

“The Singapore hospitality sector has surpassed expectations with continued buoyancy in hotel room rates driving revenue per available room growth that are currently well above pre-pandemic levels, despite a slow Chinese travel recovery,” RHB’s Natarajan said.

“The near-term outlook for the Singapore hospitality sector remains bright, with a strong event pipeline until mid-2024,” he added.

Market watchers also described the industrial and logistics subsector as a “bright spot”.

“Demand continues to outpace supply on the back of supply-chain shifts, resulting in steady rental growth, especially for high-quality ramp-up logistics and cold-storage logistics facilities,” Natarajan said.

Koh noted that S-Reits which invested in logistics properties, such as Frasers Logistics and Commercial Trust : BUOU +0.93%, and CapitaLand Ascendas Reit : A17U +1.52%, also reported “healthy positive rental reversions”.

“Logistics and hospitality still remain the preferred subsectors,” said Maybank’s Guha.

With macroeconomic uncertainties still lurking on the horizon, however, the analysts expect the S-Reits’ disappointing DPU performance to carry on into the second half of 2023.

GCP Global’s Yap noted that S-Reits have been “in the doldrums” for about 18 months.

“In terms of tenure, this is the longest correction after the Global Financial Crisis and pandemic,” he said. “In terms of magnitude of losses, it is the second-largest loss at 21 per cent – second only to the 22.3 per cent loss suffered during the Taper Tantrum of May 2013.”

Guha expects H2 to be “a continuation of H1”; Koh is predicting negative impact from a refinancing of borrowings in H2.

Natarajan nevertheless remains positive on the sector. “We believe sharp sector corrections of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent are opportunities for investors to accumulate high-quality S-Reits with strong capital positions.”"
2023-08-23,Keppel Corp should use private fund to buy up undervalued Keppel Reit,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/keppel-corp-should-use-private-fund-buy-undervalued-keppel-reit,"HELPED by a S$3.3 billion disposal gain from divesting its offshore and marine business, Keppel Corporation : BN4 +0.76% posted a record net profit for H1 2023 of over S$3.6 billion.

Keppel Corp paid its shareholders an interim cash dividend of S$0.15 per share on Aug 18. The group has also proposed paying a dividend in specie (DIS) of one Keppel Reit : K71U +1.2% (KReit) unit for every five Keppel Corp shares held.

Post the proposed distribution of 9.4 per cent of KReit, Keppel Corp will remain as KReit’s largest unitholder, with a stake of about 37.1 per cent. The trust is managed by a subsidiary of Keppel Corp’s asset management arm, Keppel Capital Holdings.


KReit’s unit price fell immediately post the announcement of the proposed DIS. Perhaps the trust faces selling pressure from some Keppel Corp shareholders who are keen to quickly offload KReit units they receive. 

As an existing investor in both Keppel Corp and KReit, I am happy to get more units in KReit via the proposed DIS. 

The proposed DIS will grow KReit’s investor base and raise the trust’s public float, thereby improving its trading liquidity. With improved liquidity, KReit’s units might trade better.   
However, the buying back and cancelling of 19.65 million units of KReit in H1, together with the move to raise its free float, may not rectify KReit’s large discount to book value.

Despite owning high-quality commercial assets in Singapore, Australia, South Korea and Japan, KReit traded at a 36 per cent discount to its net asset value (NAV) of S$1.34 as at end-June, based on the unit price as at Aug 22. 

Meanwhile, trusts owning commercial assets such as CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust : C38U +1.69% (CICT) and Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust : N2IU +2.19% (MPACT) traded at narrower discounts to end-June NAV of under 15 per cent, based on unit prices as at Aug 22.

KReit’s S$9.2 billion commercial property portfolio as at end-June is smaller than the portfolios of CICT and MPACT. Unlike KReit, the latter two are members of the benchmark Straits Times Index. 

Perhaps KReit should merge with either CICT or MPACT. KReit’s unitholders can swap their KReit units for units in an enlarged CICT or MPACT, which may trade at a superior book value multiple versus KReit. 

But Keppel Corp could be loath to support a merger involving KReit that sees it lose fund management revenue from managing the trust. Such fee income is recurrent in nature and the profit margin can be good. 

Fund management ambitions
Keppel Corp is laser-focused to grow its funds under management (FUM) – S$53.2 billion as at end-June, of which 62 per cent is tied to real estate – to S$100 billion by 2026 and S$200 billion by 2030.

To achieve ambitious FUM growth targets, an area that Keppel Corp needs to excel in is raising funds from investors. Perhaps Keppel Corp can impress potential investors by showing it is proactive in addressing a situation where a listed trust trades poorly, as is the case with KReit.

Provided KReit’s book value is robust, Keppel Corp can work with partners in a private fund to privatise KReit based on an offer price of around the trust’s NAV. 

Private fund investors may like KReit’s assets.

Around 79 per cent of KReit’s portfolio are Singapore assets – mainly Grade A office buildings. The Singapore assets comprise 79.9 per cent of Ocean Financial Centre in Raffles Place, one-third of Marina Bay Financial Centre, one-third of One Raffles Quay and 100 per cent of Keppel Bay Tower in the HarbourFront area. 

These Singapore properties enjoyed occupancy rates of between 98 per cent and 100 per cent as at end-June. Each of the properties saw net property income in H1 rise year on year. And the valuation of KReit’s Singapore portfolio as at end-June inched up from six months ago.  

All KReit’s Singapore office assets have maintained Building and Construction Authority Green Mark Platinum certification.

High-quality centrally-located office buildings here can be competitive in securing tenants due to Singapore’s ability to draw businesses from diverse sectors as well as flight to quality among businesses who are fighting for talent. Also, staff in many businesses in Singapore are spending large amounts of time working from physical offices.

Capital values of premier office towers in Singapore are supported by institutions and super-wealthy families seeking safe-haven assets in gateway cities. 

If interest rates peak and then soften, capital values of investment properties can get a boost. As at Aug 21, the 10-year Singapore government bond yield was about 3.2 per cent per annum, versus around 3.5 per cent in early November 2022. 

Since KReit’s listing in 2006, its manager has actively rejigged the trust’s portfolio via acquisitions and divestments. Unitholders can draw assurance from the manager’s focus on driving individual asset performance with proactive leasing and cost-management strategies. The trust’s debt maturity is well-spread out, and about 76 per cent of borrowings are on fixed rates as at end-June. 

Still, KReit is unloved by the market. In contrast, stable-mate Keppel DC Reit : AJBU +1.47%, which focuses on data centres, trades well above book value.

To wow potential investors, Keppel Corp needs to have its listed trusts trade like Keppel DC Reit and not like KReit. Resolving KReit’s undervaluation can help Keppel Corp in growing its FUM and getting investors to give Keppel Corp a better valuation."
2023-08-23,Quarz: Preparatory work for Sabana Reit’s internal manager should take no more than 3 to 4 months,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/quarz-preparatory-work-sabana-reits-internal-manager-should-take-no-more-3-4,"ACTIVIST investor Quarz Capital has declared that the trustee of Sabana Industrial Real Estate Investment Trust (Sabana Reit) should take no more than three to four months to do the preparatory work required to set up a new internal Reit manager.

Laying this out in its open letter on Wednesday (Aug 23), Quarz also said that delays in the setup by the trustee, HSBC Institutional Trust Services, would prejudice the interest of the Reit’s unitholders.

The activist investor, which holds units of Sabana Reit, said it came up with the three- to four-month window for preparatory work from its engagement with stakeholders, service providers and professionals with strong track records in setting up new Reit managers, following the Reit’s Aug 7 extraordinary general meeting.
Preparatory work refers to the incorporation and setup of the internal manager, human resource considerations, documentations, and filling up the application form for the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), it noted.

Quarz said in the letter: “All (the engaged parties) outlined clear and straightforward processes which the trustee can set up and license the internal manager, due to the transparent and precise application process and licensing requirements provided by MAS.”

They agreed that the preparatory work required to submit the application for the licence to MAS should not take longer than three to four months, Quarz pointed out.
It also expressed confidence in the level of expertise and number of precedent cases that would support the trustee in expediting the setup of the internal manager, and noted that MAS has approved more than 45 Reit management and 1,000 capital markets services fund management licences.

Quarz also noted that a number of law firms have strong track records in this area of work, having set up more than five new Reit managers each; such firms can “strongly support” Sabana in this process.

Quarz said that since HSBC Institutional Trust Services has repeatedly stated that its responsibility is to support unitholders and act in their best interests, it should push forward the internalisation “swiftly and decisively”.

This means that the trustee should set a clear target to complete the setup and licensing of the internal manager by the Reit’s April 2024 annual general meeting, it said.

Doing so would require the trustee to give unitholders a clear, detailed timeline of the process, for the sake of accountability and transparency, it added. The trustee should also give a breakdown of the amount of time needed for preparatory work before submitting the application to MAS, it said.

In so saying, Quarz stressed: “We remind the trustee that any delay in the setup process of the new internal manager clearly prejudices the interest of all unitholders.”

It reiterated: “Any delay in the setup prejudices the interest of all unitholders and is in conflict with the trustee’s key responsibility to safeguard unitholders.”"
2023-08-27,Singapore-based office S-Reits resilient despite concerns sparked by WeWork,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/singapore-based-office-s-reits-resilient-despite-concerns-sparked-wework,"HEADWINDS for the global office real estate segment has been under focus after office-sharing firm WeWork raised “substantial doubt” in its ability to continue its business.

However, Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (S-Reits) are showing signs of resiliency in their office portfolios.

While there are three Reits listed in Singapore that have limited exposure to the New York-headquartered WeWork – CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT) : C38U +1.69%, Suntec Reit : T82U 0%, and Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust (MPACT) : N2IU +2.19% – other Reits with heavy office portfolios such as Keppel Reit : K71U +1.2% and OUE Commercial Reit : TS0U 0% have also seen consumer sentiment hold up alongside high occupancy rates and growth in rental reversions.
For the first half of FY2023, CICT reported higher gross revenue and net property income of 19.6 per cent and 14.8 per cent year on year, respectively, for its office portfolio.

Year to date, rent reversion for CICT’s office portfolio grew 9.6 per cent, outpacing that of its retail portfolio, which recorded a 6.9 per cent growth.

Its office portfolio’s occupancy rate rose quarter on quarter, marginally improving from 94.8 per cent to 95.4 per cent.
WeWork was one of CICT’s top 10 tenants for the month of June, with 2.4 per cent of total gross rent contributing to CICT’s total gross rental income.

The Singapore central business district (CBD) was CICT’s second-highest revenue stream (27.7 per cent) for the first half of the year.

A recent Knight Frank report that found that businesses in Singapore were “not deterred from continuing to seek quality spaces in the CBD, supporting the strong occupancy levels in the office market”.

CICT echoed that view, seeing healthy demand for its office assets coming from private wealth and asset management companies, law firms, professional services and government agencies – combined with a tighter supply ahead for Singapore’s CBD expected beyond 2023.

Suntec Reit’s Singapore office portfolio recorded year-on-year growth in both gross revenue and net property income for H1 FY2023 by 8.1 per cent and 1.1 per cent respectively, citing higher occupancy and rent at its Suntec City Office and One Raffles Quay.

The Reit’s Singapore office portfolio was near full occupancy as at Jun 30, 2023, with its overall Singapore occupancy at 99.3 per cent and its core CBD occupancy at 94.8 per cent.
Its office assets also marked 20 quarters of positive rent reversion and came in at 10.8 per cent for H1 FY2023.

Co-working spaces remained a minor portion of Suntec Reit’s office portfolio at roughly 3 per cent as at Jun 30.

WeWork consisted of 1.9 per cent of Suntec Reit’s total monthly office gross rental income, according to Suntec Reit’s 2022 annual report.

MPACT’s Mapletree Business City had 95.9 per cent committed occupancy with 7.1 per cent rental reversion. Year on year, MPACT’s gross revenue and net property income for Q1 FY2023/24 were up 75.6 per cent and 68.0 per cent respectively, with its Singapore properties delivering better performance more than offsetting higher utility expenses."
2023-08-28,Brokers’ take: Citi downgrades highly-geared Lendlease Global Reit to ‘neutral’,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/brokers-take-citi-downgrades-highly-geared-lendlease-global-reit-neutral,"CITI Research downgraded its call on Lendlease Global Commercial Real Estate Investment Trust (Lendlease Global Reit : JYEU 0%) to “neutral” from “buy” in view of rising capital management concerns and valuations pricing in a potential equity fundraising.

After shaving its distribution per unit (DPU) estimates for FY2024 to FY2025 to account for higher debt costs and delays in completion of the Reit’s multifunctional space, the research house now has a lower price target of S$0.61 compared to S$0.78 previously.

The new target also implies a higher discount rate resulting from higher gearing and benign DPU growth, along with an increased portfolio cap rate, said analyst Brandon Lee on Sunday (Aug 27).


He highlighted that the Reit’s implied capitalisation rate of about 5.8 per cent stands higher than its portfolio’s 4.5 per cent cap rate. Its price-to-book valuation of 0.75 times stands much lower than its pre-Covid and long-term mean ratios, in his view. 

“Therefore, we think the market could be pricing in some form of equity fund-raising due to (Lendlease Global Reit’s) high gearing,” said the analyst. 

Lendlease Global Reit’s latest gearing of 40.6 per cent for Q4 represents its highest since listing, noted Lee.
He estimates a look-through gearing of 50.5 per cent, which makes it the highest-geared Singapore-listed Reit (S-Reit) under Citi’s coverage.

Based on the analyst’s projections, equity requirements of S$500 million to S$600 million will be required to attain a desired look-through gearing of 35 to 38 per cent, which would result in a lower pro forma net asset value per share.

Though the Reit could also potentially sell its sole non-domestic asset Sky Complex to improve its headline and look-through gearing, Lee cautioned of a challenging transactions market in Europe due to high interest rates.

“While we do not see near-term risk of Singapore retail cap rate expansion, we understand investors typically remain wary of higher-geared S-Reits in a rising interest rate climate.”

Lendlease Global Reit, which counts 313@Somerset among its portfolio investments in Singapore, has an adjusted interest coverage ratio (ICR) of two times. This also represents the lowest ICR among Citi’s covered S-Reits, said Lee, with FY2024’s projected ICR slightly lower at 1.8 times.

Units of Lendlease Commercial were up S$0.005 or 0.9 per cent at S$0.595 as at the midday trading break on Monday. "
2023-08-30,Frasers Centrepoint Trust to divest Changi City Point for S$338 million,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/frasers-centrepoint-trust-divest-changi-city-point-s338-million,"FRASERS : J69U +2.87% Centrepoint Trust : J69U +2.87% (FCT) will divest retail mall Changi City Point for S$338 million to an unrelated third party.

The capital gain on the property is estimated at S$20 million, after taking into account the property’s independent valuation of S$325 million as at Jul 31, its manager said on Wednesday (Aug 30).

Changi City Point, which comprises three storeys and one basement, has a net lettable area spanning 208,453 square feet (sq ft) and gross floor area of 306,378 sq ft. It has a 60-year lease which started on Apr 30, 2009.
The mall is located at 5 Changi Business Park Central 1 and is connected to Expo MRT station. This train stop also serves as an interchange station between the Downtown Line and the East-West Line, which goes to Changi Airport.

The property has 128 tenants, including key tenants FairPrice Finest and Daiso. Total shopper traffic stood at about 7.5 million for the period between October 2021 and September 2022.

The purchaser, which was not named, will pay a deposit of S$16.9 million for the property after signing the sales and purchase agreement on Aug 29. The remaining balance will be paid when the transaction is completed on Nov 15, 2023.
The manager said net proceeds from the sale will be used to repay certain debts. This allows the real estate investment trust (Reit) to lower its gearing and boost its financial position.

Based on pro forma estimates as at Jun 30, the manager expects FCT’s portfolio occupancy rate to rise to 99.3 per cent from 98.7 per cent.

The average remaining lease tenure of the Reit’s portfolio will also rise by 2.3 years, and portfolio tenant sales is projected to climb by 3.9 per cent. Average gross rent per sq ft is also estimated to increase by 3.7 per cent.

FCT units closed 0.5 per cent or S$0.01 higher at S$2.21 on Tuesday."
2023-08-31,EC World Reit suspends trading in midst of financing woes,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/ec-world-reit-suspends-trading-midst-financing-woes,"UNITS of EC World Real Estate Investment Trust : BWCU 0% (EC World Reit) have been suspended from trading effective Thursday (Aug 31). This is after its manager said the Reit and its subsidiaries, or ECW Group, were unable to fully repay their offshore interest expenses due the same day.

The Reit’s suspension comes after its manager flagged a “high risk” of non-collection of outstanding rent receivables.

To recap, EC World Reit and its subsidiaries are owed more than 145.8 million yuan (S$27.5 million) in overdue rent receivables by their sponsor group Forchn Holdings and its subsidiaries.
The rent receivables are spread across ECW Group’s four master-leased properties in China, including Fu Heng Warehouse.

As at Aug 28, its manager noted that ECW Group’s free cash had been significantly depleted due to a refinancing exercise in 2019, where it repaid about S$131.1 million to its lenders – out of which S$56.8 million was funded by the group’s excess cash.

The offshore interest reserve maintained by ECW Group is required to be topped up within five business days of its release.
The Reit manager said that it expects meeting such a requirement to be “challenging” given ECW Group’s financial position, unless the sponsor group manages to pay a “sufficient” amount of the rent receivables within the given timeframe.

Breaching this requirement would also trigger a cross-default under ECW Group’s existing onshore facilities. The manager noted that this may prompt relevant lenders to accelerate the facilities, or in other words, demand repayment. It has requested these lenders not to do so.

It also asked the offshore facilities’ agent to release part of its offshore interest reserve such that ECW Group may fully repay the offshore interest expenses.

EC World Reit’s manager is further seeking an extension of time to top up the said offshore interest reserve.

Relevant lenders of the facilities are in the process of reviewing these requests, said EC World Reit’s manager.

A voluntary trading suspension would, therefore, be in the best interest of unitholders, it added, as this would ensure no trading takes place without sufficient information required to make an informed decision.

EC World Reit’s manager said that it will seek to lift the trading suspension as soon as appropriate without compromising the interests of the Reit’s unitholders.

Its board is also in the process of “evaluating various options” for the Reit, the manager added.

EC World Reit units last changed hands at S$0.28 on Monday. The counter has been untraded since."
2023-08-31,"Broker’s take: Keppel Reit could see price rise as distribution in specie date approaches, DBS says",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/brokers-take-keppel-reit-could-see-price-rise-distribution-specie-date-approaches,"DBS Group Research on Thursday (Aug 31) said that it sees a tactical opportunity for Keppel Reit : K71U +1.2% units as the timeline for Keppel Corp’s distribution of the real estate investment trust’s units progresses.

Keppel Corp : BN4 +0.76% announced on Jul 27 that its shareholders would receive one Keppel Reit unit for every five Keppel Corp shares held to mark the conglomerate’s 55th anniversary.

Contrary to common belief, the research team observed that a counter subject to a distribution tends to go up rather than down in the period between the initial announcement date and completion date.


This was the case for CDL Hospitality Trusts and CapitaLand Ascott Trust (Clas), it noted.

“While past observation is no guarantee of future performance, we are cautiously optimistic that the same behaviour may pan out for Keppel Reit,” DBS noted.

DBS believes that the Reit’s unit price may exceed its assumed completion price after the distribution is approved at a shareholder’s meeting, which usually occurs around two months after the initial announcement.

DBS is projecting an upside towards S$0.96 for the counter, 10 per cent higher than Keppel Reit’s last trading price of S$0.87 as at 4.10 pm on Thursday. The counter was up 1.2 per cent or S$0.01 at the time.

The research team took into account the resilient outlook of the Singapore office market, Keppel Reit’s “best-in-class” portfolio, an anticipated end to the Federal Reserve rate hike cycle, as well as Keppel Reit’s attractive valuations.

The Reit is currently trading at 0.65 times its book value and a forward yield of 6.8 per cent."
